	<h1 id="1">First!</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	First entry of 2019. I spent December 30th dopamine fasting and chilled on new years eve. I kind of did nothing yesterday but I'm still on my routine. I had a lot of realizations on this fast and ideas about myself particularly. I have all the knowledge now I need to implement them. I feel that 2019 is going to be a good year. 2018 has been extremely life changing. Improve everyday. Currently I am going to resume 12 rules and I'm taking an online course on the science of exercise. I want to go to LindyGroove tomorrow and I've studied up on IP's BeeFriend course. Fasting was good in realizing my demon and internal struggles. It's been cold these days but I've endured.

	<h1 id="2">ATP</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	I've been learning about the science behind exercise this week/today. It has been a good in-depth look at how muscles and energy work, literally. ATP is the reason why our muscles move and is the basis for physical work. A fundamental reaction can build and stack upon itself and eventually even get a man to space, wow. Not much else happening, yesterday we finally beat borderlands 2, op8 and all the raid bosses. I've been feeling kind of demotivated lately and binging zero sum rewards. I think going to LindyGroove tonight will get me out of it. Positive sum rewards right? The cold and the lack of progress is weighing on me. One of the downsides to vacations. Let's read more and watch less. That will be my motto. I'm also going to be more engaging with people to build acquaintances and perhaps friendships. Pretty much do the opposite of last friday. ED: Dad turned off power today to install a new thermostat. I was angry at first but meditated instead to relieve the emotions. Let's get it.

	It's a friday and I'm feeling good. I went with Derek to my first LindyGroove. I think it went really well. I wasn't really nervous and got the basics down. I'm pretty awkward still but I can easily get it down with practice. Last night we did not have the heat on. It was a bit of suffering. Apparently I've gotten comfortable with the heat on every night. A good wake up call I think. Tomorrow me and the FT boys are going to get Sushi Me, a new ayce place in Alhambra. It's going to be good. Somewhat late start today but I'll manage. Too much Twitch.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Today I went to Sushi Me. It was delicious but really similar to all the other ayce spots in the area. The belly was good and the service was good. We then went to Almansor park and walked around. It started raining while we were walking to Vincent Lugo Park. From the outside the park was pretty plain but inside was pretty cool. There's a certain charm to walking through a beautiful without other people around. I got soaked and drove home. When I got home I discord with Derek and Chris about relationships. I'm the last person to ask for advice but it was insightful. Today was a good day but my mentality was pretty out of it right now. ED: Mood has been depressed. Solution: ?

	<h1 id="5">Bonsai</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	I relapsed today. Home alone, lonely, anxious, depressed. Not good circumstances. I'm trying to 180 the day at least be productive with my time for the rest of the day. Jake was with Ao yesterday and it was cool. They ate at an american breakfast cafe and made bonsais. Jake said something along the lines of "somethings need to be destroyed before they can grow again" I believe this is true for humans too. The superego needs to take over and implode before the mind can be whole. I'm still learning about the psyche but I think that mental duress can help open the mind. That's why we need to try something that scares us. Only then can the mind collapse and rebuild, stronger.

	<h1 id="6">Modern Dance</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	I woke up pretty early today and worked out. I went to my modern dance class at around noon. It was a bit strange and my first impressions are often really bad reads. Three girls really stood out to me. The class itself was weird to me mostly because of how foreign it was. I've never danced without shoes and socks. I think this might be good for me to get out of my comfort zone and become used to acting weird to a point that it becomes normal. It's all expression after all and there's no wrong way to do that. I was actually expecting the class to be more like jazz or hip hop dancing or like club dancing but it's a lot more like free form dancing with yoga and ballet. There's a lot of stretching and flexibility, range of motion. I'll keep at it since I've committed.

	<h1 id="7">Patch Day</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Gw2 patch day for All or Nothing. It's the first patch of 2019 and I'm quite excited about it. I've been playing this game for almost five years now and it has been an experience. It has been an escape from all the ups and downs of life and place of comfort. I could go on for days about gw2 but for now lets return to real life. Yesterday was pretty good. I managed to read for more than an hour and watched rift rival practice streams. I got to stop spending so much time on twitch. It's hypocritical of me for criticizing the world for being brainless screen zombies when I myself am one too. Set your own house in perfect order before you criticize the world.

	<h1 id="8">Cutest Fucking Thing</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Yesterday I ate dinner ate Grandma's house. Had some deep talks with Derek about jury duty and summer school. Today I woke up and worked out. Went to modern dance an hour later. It's getting a little less weird but I'm not 100% comfortable yet. I had a nice interaction with Amanda today. I need to practice my ballet terms and techniques. Also yesterday I watched the Raj Patel king of the hill with big streamers. Sodapopin won between xQC and Greekgodx. Yeah I don't feel like typing more.

	<h1 id="9">Beast</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	The new beasts units are coming out for FeH. I'm not too excited for them even though I was originally disappointed the game didn't have them on release. Besides that I finished the latest episode of Gw2 All or Nothing. It was nothing. Aurene dead. F. In modern dance we had a substitute who taught us some similar stuff. It was alright. A bit of freestyle 8 count was the most memorable thing during this session. A few people were missing I think because of the substitute. Today is lindygroove but I'm having doubts. It's a fun experience but I don't seem to be practising or experiencing much. The $8 for less than an hour of lessons really grinds my gears. Social dance next semester should be cool. I'm going to find a better source of income. Right now I'm saving for the dog but my financial independence isn't there yet.

	<h1 id="10">Jury Duty</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Yesterday I had jury duty. It wasn't bad. My first time at the Pasadena court house. I signed in, went through the basics, read a bit, then went on a two hour lunch break. I walked to Ramen Tatsunoya and had a very rich broth ramen for $19. I chilled at the park on the way back and went back to jury duty. The case itself was really interesting. Something about Carrie Fisher's holdings being disputed by a mother of a heroin user? Apparently it was a pretty big case since there were 113 of us just on Friday and 30ish already coming back Tuesday. I really wanted to find out more about the case since the best lawyers in America were on this case. It also dealt with medicine, drugs, entertainment industry, and some law. But selecting 12ish jurors in a pool of 60-70 people yeah right. I also had dance classes to attend so it was a good way to excuse myself. I'm curious about the case but happy to not do it. After that I walked across the street and read at the Pasadena library. It seemed historic and proper but I was tired. This Saturday morning I woke up late and worked out since I missed it yesterday. It seems that my Twitch habits haven't improved, I spend so much time watching vods or streams. Habit is a bitch. One last note I would like to add is that the experience yesterday showed me that people come from all walks of life and each person is experienced in their own way. To have predispositions and prejudices about anything on an individual is a fault that everyone makes. Even the judge must serve as jury.
