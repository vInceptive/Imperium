	<h1 id="1">How To Win Friends And Influence People</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	So this was one of my earliest books I read when I began reading as a hobby in late 2015/early 2016. I want to remind myself that, as the book reminds us, knowledge is useless if it is not practiced or action is not taken.<br><br>
	Part 1 
	<br><br>
	1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain. <br>
	2. Give honest and sincere appreciation. <br>
	3. Arouse in the other person an eager want. "Don't you think?" <br>
	<blockquote>“It lies in the ability to get the
other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your
own." -Henry Ford </blockquote><br>
	Part 2 
	<br><br>
	1. Become genuinely interested in other people <br>
	2. Smile. <br> 
	3. Remember a person's name, it is the most important thing to a being. <br>
	4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. F.O.R.D. <br>
	5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests. <br>
	6. Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely. <br> <br>
	Part 3 
	<br><br>
	1. The best argument is to avoid it. <br>
	2. Show respect to other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong." <br>
	3. If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. <br>
	4. Begin in a friendly way. <br>
	5. Get the other person saying "yes, yes" immediately.<br>
	6. Let the other person do a great deal of talking. <br>
	7. Let the other person feel that the idea is theirs.<br>
	8. Try to see things of the other person's point of view. <br>
	9. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires. <br>
	10. Appeal to the nobler motives. (get them to think of other people, not just themselves, in a way that benefits you.) <br>
	11. Dramatize your ideas.<br>
	<p><blockquote>"Words alone will not win people to your way of thinking. You need to use word pictures or actually
demonstrate the idea for impact. Take a hundred-dollar bill and begin asking whether it can lose its value
by crumpling, dropping, or stepping on it, as you crumple, drop, and step on it. It is a vivid and visual
reminder that each of us has value, a value that cannot be diminished, no matter how life has crumpled
and stepped on us. That is an unforgettable moment. <br><br>
When we want to make a point, we need to tell a story. The story will stick long after the facts have been
forgotten. We need to learn to be weavers of tales and demonstrators of ideas. More can be said in a
story or an example than we could ever say directly. That's because a story or dramatization involves the
listener or observer. They add their own experience and imagination to the story. It is a mutual activity
that builds a bond between the teller and the audience. Communication is something we ought to make
fun and attractive. When it is done well, it leaves our audience hungry and thirsty for more. <br><br>
I use a number of visualizations when I talk to people. I have a selection to draw from as the occasion
arises. When I read, listen, or watch, I'm always looking for those types of examples and illustrations that
are the most effective dramatizations of the message I want to convey." </blockquote></p>
	12. Throw down a challenge. <br>
	<p><blockquote>"Smith needed a strong man to run Sing Sing and sent for Lewis E. Lawes of New Hampton.
“How about going up to take charge of Sing Sing?” he said jovially, when Lawes stood before him. “They need a man up there with experience.”<br><br>
Lawes was stumped. He knew the dangers of Sing Sing prison, and the appointment was a political one, subject to political whims. Wardens had come and gone at Sing Sing—one only lasting three weeks. He had a career to consider. Was it worth the risk?<br><br>
Smith saw his hesitation and smiled. “Young fellow,” he said, “I don’t blame you for being scared. It’s a tough spot. It’ll take a big man to go up there and stay.”<br><br>
Smith threw down a challenge and Lawes liked the idea of attempting a job that called for a big man.
Lawes not only went on to take the warden’s job, he stayed and became the most famous warden alive. His book, “20,000 Years in Sing Sing,” sold into the hundreds of thousand of copies. He had broadcasts on the air, and his stories of prison life have inspired dozens of movies. Also, his “humanizing” of criminals brought about miracles in the way of prison reform.<br><br>
Every person loves the chance for self-expression and the opportunity to prove his or her worth, to excel, to win. So if you want to win people to your way of thinking, when all else fails, Throw down a challenge. </blockquote></p><br>
	Part 4 
	<br><br>
	1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.<br>
	2. Indirectly call people's mistakes.<br>
	3. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.<br>
	4. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. <br>
	5. Let the other person save face. <br>
	6. Praise slightest improvement and every improvement. <br>
	7. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.<br>
	8. Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct. <br>
	9. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest. <br>
