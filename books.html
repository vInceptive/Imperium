	-General tips: <ind> Get a holistic/clear view. Expect some pacifying behaviors. Expect initial nervousness. Get the person to relax first. Establish a baseline. Look for increased use of pacifiers. Ask, pause, and observe. Keep the person focused. Chatter is not truth. Stress coming in -> distancing, stress out -> pacifiers. Isolate the cause of stress. Pacifiers say so much. Look for synchrony between verbal/nonverbal. </ind>
	-Observing emphasis is important because it is universal when people are being genuine. <br>
	<blockquote>"Last, be careful not to label someone a liar with limited information or based on one observation. Many good relationships have been ruined this way." </blockquote>

	<h1 id="3">As A Man Thinketh</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	<h2> Chapter 1: Thought and Character</h2>
	Allen writes that "A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all of his thoughts. And since "...cause and effect are as absolute and undeviating in the hidden realm of thought as in the world of visible and material things," we determine (or at least heavily influence) our situation in life... essentially sleeping in the bed we have made. According to the author, "Man is made or unmade by himself" and can improve his lot in life by thinking "right" thoughts and by the right choice of the application of thought (i.e., choosing the "right" actions and behaviors). <br><br>
	<h2> Chapter 2: Effect of Thought on Circumstances</h2> 
	Allen writes that "The outer conditions of a person's life will always be found to be harmoniously related to his inner state. This does not mean that a man's circumstances at any giving time are an indication of his entire character, but that those circumstances are so intimately connected with some vital thought-element within himself that, for the time being, they are indispensable to his development." Essentially, that we are where we are based on our thoughts and our actions. Not that external factors don't have influence, but that on balance we are each the master of our own destiny. <br><br>
	<h2> Chapter 3: Effects of Thoughts on Health and Body </h2> 
	"The body is the servant of the mind. It obeys the operations of the mind, whether they be deliberately chosen or automatically expressed," Allen writes.  And that, upon the body, "habits of thought will produce their own effects, good or bad." Ever heard the saying clean body, clean mind, clean living? That's what Allen is getting at here; that "The people who live in fear of disease are the people who get it" and that "A sour face does not come by chance; it is made by sour thoughts."<br><br>
	<h2>Chapter 4: Thought and Purpose</h2>
	"They who have no central purpose in their life fall an easy prey to petty worries, fears, troubles, and self-pityings...which lead to failure, unhappiness, and loss, for weakness cannot persist in the power-evolving universe." "To put away aimlessness and weakness and to begin to think with purpose is to enter the ranks of those strong one who only recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment." "The will to do springs from the knowledge that we can do. Doubt and fear are the great enemies of knowledge, and he who encourages them, who does not slay them, thwarts himself at every step."<br><br>
	<h2>Chapter 5: The Thought-Factor in Achievement</h2>
	Allen's opening statement in this chapter: "All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts." And his ending statement: "He who would accomplish little need sacrifice little; he who would achieve much must sacrifice much. He who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly." I've always believed that, when combined with a purpose, hard work and persistence are key elements to success. You've got to be able to fight for what you believe in and be willing to sacrifice to achieve it. <br><br>
	<h2> Chapter 6: Visions and Ideals</h2> 
	"To desire is to obtain; to aspire is to achieve. Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so shall you become. Your vision is the promise of what you shall one day be; your ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil. The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream. The oak sleeps in the acorn; the bird waits in the egg. And in the highest vision of a soul a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the seedlings of realities. You will become as small as your controlling desire; as great as your dominant aspiration." <br><br>
	<h2> Chapter 7: Serenity</h2> 
	"That exquisite poise of character that we call serenity is the last lesson of culture. Calmness of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. It is the result of long and patient effort in self-control. Its presence is an indication of ripened experience, and of a more than ordinary knowledge of the laws and operations of thought. Keep your hands firmly upon the helm of thought."<br><br>

	-Alter a habit of addiction into a beneficial/pleasurable habit, one that makes you happier/healthier/wealthier. <br>
	-Habit Loop: Cue -> Routine -> Reward <br>
	-Habits take almost a year to reach the line of automaticity. Keep at it. <br>
	-Progress is not lost if you miss a day or two. Missing consecutive days is detrimental. Don't focus on numerical streaks just keep resisting urge to binge and keep going. <br><br>
	<h2>How to Properly Build Habits</h2>
	-Cue: pick something that occurs everyday at around the same time. <br>
	-Routine: focus on showing up. Set a low/high bar. <br>
	-Reward: pick something primitive/pleasurable. Food, sex, play, relaxation. <br><br>
	<h2>Willpower is like a muscle!</h2>
	-The more you use your willpower, the more tired it gets. <br>
	-When the muscle fails you reach ego depletion. <br>
	<ind><b>Ego depletion: the state where the brain is slower, prone to errors, emotions are harder to control, pain tolerance is lowered, decision making is impaired, more implusive, and temptations become stronger. </b></ind> <br>
	<h2>What Drains Willpower?</h2> 
	1. Mental Processes; thinking hard. <br>
	<ind>-Find more efficient ways to think less</ind> 
	2. Resisting Urges<br>
	<ind>-Change environment when urges appear <br>
	-Become mindful of the urge, notice it, think about noticing it, and about how it makes you feel; don't act on it.</ind>
	3. Decision Fatigue; making choices <br>
	<ind>-Implementation intention: write decisions down. </ind> 
	4. Other ways to lower willpower use: <br>
	-amount of willpower decreases as you reach line of automaticity<br>
	-learn to love your rountine; research benefits, become a fan/subscriber, surround yourself with images/people/ideas that support the habit. <br><br>
	<h2>Recharging Willpower (30% Physiological)</h2> 
	1. Eat low-glycemic foods. <br>
	2. Switch to standby mode; Go for a walk or meditate. <br>
	3. Get enough sleep. <br>
	<h2>Recharging Willpower (70% Psychological)</h2>
	1. Chunking: taking a large task ad breaking it down into tiny manageable tasks. <br>
	<ind>We have infinite willpower but brain puts limits to prevent burnout.</ind> 
	2. Confidence: more confidence/less willpower required. Repetition = confidence. <br>
	3. Change your view of willpower (mindset) <br>
	<ind> -The amount of willpower I have is infinite <br>
	-The brain likes to put limits <br>
	-Learning about willpower allows me to tap into more of my willpower </ind>
	4. Identity (identity that aligns with goals or habits you're trying to build) <br>
	-change your language/vocabulary. <br>
	-"I am not a X addict." <br>
	-Remove phrases like: "I have to.. I must.. I should.. I can't.. I will eventually.." <br>
	-Use "I want to because.." Know the reason and cling to it. <br>
	5. High-level thinking <br>
	-Spend more time thinking long term, more general, and ask why. This creates a sense of purpose and meaning
	<h2>Six Fundamental Human Needs</h2> 
	1. Certainty: basic human needs like food, shelter, security.<br>
	2. Variety: some sort of excitement; hobbies, adventure, new things/people. <br>
	3. Significance: sense of importance, that we matter, what we daydream about achieving. <br>
	4. Love/connection: deep bonds with others, improve social and conversational skills. <br>
	5. Growth: improvement in life, progress over stagnation. <br>
	6. Contribution: giving back; work on yourself so you can give back and spread happiness and in turn receive happiness. <br>

	<h1 id="7">Emotions Revealed</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	<h2>Chapter 1</h2> 

		-Expressions are universal.<br>
		-Emotion is a process, influenced by evolution and personal experience.<br>
		-There are more than ten thousand expressions; they can be categorized as: anger, fear, sadness, disgust, comtempt, surprise, and enjoyment. <br>

	<br>
	<h2>Chapter 2</h2> 
	Why do we become emotional and when do we do so?

		-Auto-appraisers trigger when something is affecting or about to affect our welfare. Going down a rollercoaster <br>
		-Reflective appraisal: when we consciously consider what is occurring, something clicks and auto-appraisers take over. Jokes/Problems<br>
		-Memory of a past emotional event. Rape/Victory/Death<br>
		-Imagination. Theorecticals. <br>
		-Talking about a past emotional trigger. Nemesis/pet/lover/traumatic event<br>
		-Empathy or by witnessing someone else's emotion reaction. Movies/books <br>
		-Other instructing us about what to be emotional about. Speeches/sermons/ACT HAPPY<br>
		-Violation of social norms. Injustice <br>
		-Voluntarily assuming the appearance of emotion sometimes brings feeling of that emotion. Fake it til you make it<br>

	<br>
	<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
	How can we control out emotions?

		There are six factors that determine how successful anyone can be in reducing the power of an emotional trigger and length of the refractory period.<br>
			1. How universally accepted the reaction to an event is. Road rage vs being criticized by boss. Both are anger triggered but one is easily suppressed. <br>
			2. How closely current triggers resemble the original situation. Getting chased by murderer vs little children.<br>
			3. How early in a person's life the trigger was learned, the earlier the trigger was learned, the harder it will be to weaken it. Being taught to fear strangers. <br>
			4. How strong the initial emotional charge was when first learned. Aggressive bullying vs mild teasing <br>
			5. How dense the experiences were, repeated episodes over a (short) period of time. Everyday vs every week. <br>
			6. How each individual reacts to emotions. Speed of response, strength of response, how long it takes for us to recover from emotional episodes. Fast, strong, and long is harder to cool off.<br>
		-Once we can recognize emotion sensations, we can think about them during and after, understanding the cause and effect of emotion helps cool it. <br>
		-Moods are different from emotions. Moods are weaker but continuous and rarely shows on the face or voice. Moods can be a result of an emotional episode. By changing emotional state we can influence mood.  <br>

	<br>
	<h2>Chapter 4</h2> 
	What is emotional behavior composed of?

		-Signals: most of our emotions have a distinctive signal that tells other how we are feeling. <br>
		-Facial expressions: the seven emotions that have distinct, universal facial expressions are sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, contempt, and happiness. <br>
		-Voice: rarely gives false emotional message, although it gives no messages at all if the person doesn't speak.<br>
		-Actions: body language.<br>
		-Physical Changes: distance, muscle tone, sweating, respiration, cardiac activity, skin temperature, and blushing.<br>
		<b>Techniques to moderate our emotional behavior: try to reappraise what is occurring and interrupt our actions, to halt our speech. It is possible to stop speech and actions but controlling the involuntary behaviour is not easy.</b>

	<br>
	<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
	How to recognize Sadness: <br>
	-By the angling upward of the inner corners of the eyebrows. <br>
	-The lips are stretched horizontally. <br>
	-The lower lip is pushed up and maybe is trembling. <br>
	-The wide open mouth adds intensity. Cheeks are raised. <br>
	-Lips conners are pulled down. <br>
	-The tip of the chin together with the lower lip is pushed upwards. <br>
	-Some people look like they are smiling in sadness but in reality the lip corners are being pulled upward by the strong action of the cheek muscle, not by the muscle that underlines smiling. <br>
	-The upper eyelids are slightly drooped. <br>
	-Narrow of eyes. <br>
	-The gazed is directed down in sadness.<br>
	We can also have a partial expression, when the signal is just in one part of the face. The eyebrows are very important, highly reliable signs of sadness. <br>
	
	<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
	How to recognize Anger: <br>
	-eyebrows are down and together, with the inner corner down toward the nose<br>
	-the upper eyelids are pushed against the lowered eyebrows<br>
	-lips are together tightly and tense<br>
	-the jaw is clenched <br>
	-teeth are exposed<br>
	-lips may be open in square or rectangular shape, or closed and pressed one against the other. The upper lip is raised and the lower one is lowered, so that the lips are narrowed. <br>
	-the red margin of the lips becomes narrower in anger, the lips become thinner. This is a very difficult action to inhibit. It is evident when a person is not yet ware of being angry. <br>
	-The heart rate increases, as does respiration. Blood pressure rises, and the face may redden.<br>
	
	<h2> Chapter 7</h2>
	How to recognize Surprise and Fear: <br>
	Surprise:<br>
	-the upper eyelids are high<br>
	-the jaw is drop open<br>
	-eyes are wide open<br><br>
	Fear:<br>
	-the upper eyelids are high<br>
	-the lower eyelids are tense<br>
	-the eyebrows are raised and drawn together<br>
	-the chin is pulled back<br>
	-the lips are stretched horizontally back toward the ears<br>
	-hands can get colder, you can breathe more deeply and rapidly, your muscles in arms and legs can feel trembling or tightening... <br>
	
	<h2> Chapter 8</h2> 
	How to recognize Disgust and Contempt <br>
	Disgust: <br>
	-upper lip is raised <br>
	-the lower lip is raised too and protruding slightly. <br>
	-the wrinkle extending from above his nostrils downward to beyond his lip corners is deep and its shape forms an inverted U.<br>
	-the cheeks are raised and the brows are lowered so that there are the crow's feet wrinkles.<br>
	-eyebrows are pulled down. <br>
	-eyelids muscles are relaxed.<br>
	<br>
	Contempt: <br>
	- upper lip is raised. <br>
	- the lower lip is raised too and protruding slightly. <br>
	- the wrinkle extending from above his nostrils downward to beyond his lip corners is deep and its shape forms an inverted U.<br>
	- the cheeks are raised and the brows are lowered so that there are the crow's feet wrinkles.<br>
	- eyebrows are pulled down. <br>
	- eyelids muscles are relaxed.<br>
	The changes in nose, mouth and lips are important, not the ones in eyes. <br>
	
	<h2> Chapter 9 </h2>
	Enjoyment: <br>
	Which are the positive emotions?<br>
	1. Sensory pleasure: there are things that feel good to touch and being touched can fell very good too. It is an open question whether the sensory pleasure are just different routes to the same emotional experience, and therefore should be considered one single emotional experience, or if we should consider them as five different emotions- visual, tactile, olfactory, auditory, gustatory pleasures. There are many different triggers, some of some universal, other different from culture to culture and experienced. Sensory pleasures are enjoyable and there are no reasons not to consider them as emotions. <br>
	2. Amusement: can vary from slight to extremely intense, while peals of laughter and even tears. <br>
	3. Excitement: arises in response to novelty or challenge. There is often a close relationship between excitement and fear. <br>
	4. Relief: it is often accompanied by a deep inhalation and exhalation of breath and it is the emotion felt when something that had strongly aroused our emotions subsides. Fear is an often precursor of relief but not always. It is not a stand alone emotion, cause it must be always preceded by some other emotion. <br>
	5. Wonder: it means being overwhelmed by something incomprehensible. It's important to separate it from fear. It is an intense, enjoyable state. Nearly everything that is incredible, incomprehensible and fascinating can be a source of wonderment. The reactions can be goose bumps, tingling on the shoulders and back of the neck, change in respiration, deep inhalations and exhalations, shaking the head. No one knows if there is a distinctive signal in face, voice or body movement for wonderment. <br>
	6. Ecstasy or bliss: state of self-transcendent rapture, achieved by some trough meditation by other through experiences in nature, and by still others a sexual experience. It is very intense. <br>
	7. Fiero: requires a difficult challenge and a very good feeling one has about oneself at the moment of accomplishment. It has helped to motivate great efforts and great achievements.<br>
	8. Gratitude: appreciation for an altruistic gift that provides benefit. When someone does something nice for you, something altruistic, we are likely to feel gratitude. It is a complicated emotion and there are major cultural differences. Ekman doubts that there is a universal gratitude signal or a unique psychological pattern of sensations that characterizes gratitude. <br>
	9. Schadenfreude: a german word to express the feeling you experience when you learn that your worst enemy has suffered; it is enjoyable even if a different kind of enjoyment than the ones we have considered so far. <br>
	10. Content: Scholars are not sure that there is a facial sign of contentment, maybe a relaxation of the facial muscles. Contentment is heard in the voice! <br>
	11. Naches: pattern of physical sensations parents feel when their child accomplishes something important, perhaps even exceeding the parents themselves. It is a yiddish word more indicate than proud. <br>
	12. Elevation: a warm, uplifting feeling that people experience when they see unexpected acts of human goodness, kindness and compassion. We become motivated with ourselves to become a better person, to engage in altruistic acts. <br>
	-Functions: these enjoyable emotions motivate our lived, they cause us to do things that by and large are good for us. They encourage us to engage in activity that is necessary for the survival of our species. They motivate our lives. <br>
	
	<h2> Chapter 10</h2>
	Takeaway: emotions depend too much on circumstances and internal thoughts. They can intermingle and be concealed so never presume anything. Say nothing about what is seen, instead be alert to the possibilities. How you respond depends on the nature of the relationship, its past history, intended future, and your knowledge of the person. Relationships work better when people understand and acknowledge how each other feels but be cautious and give room for privacy. <br><br>

	Guilt, shame, envy and embarrassment are also emotions that do not have universal expressions and are mostly concealed thereby more difficult to see. <br><br>

	<h1 id="8">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: <p style="font-size: 12px;">The Japanese art of decluttering and organizing</p></h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	<p>Ch. 1 Why can't I keep my house in order?</p>
	<p>-p10 When it comes to tidying, we are all self-taught.</p>
	<p>-p11 Food, clothing, and, shelter are the most basic humans needs, so you would think that where we live would be considered just as important as what we eat and what we wear.</p>
	<p>-p15 People cannot change their habits without first changing their way of thinking.</p>
	<p>-p17 <strong>On motivation and efforts. </strong>Even if they are initially inspired, they can't stay motivated and their efforts peter out. The root cause lies in the fact that they can't see the results or feel the effects. This is precisely why success depends on experiencing tangible results immediately. (primitive rewards)? If you use the right method and concerntrate your efforts on eliminating clutter thoroughly and completely within a short span of time, you'll see instant results that will empower you to keep your space in order ever after.</p>
	<p>-p21 <strong>On distractions and objectives</strong>. Distracted by the "need" to tidy my room, it took me so long to get down to studying that my grades were always terrible.</p>
	<p>-p21 <strong>"a messy room equals a messy mind"</strong> The act of cluttering is really an instinctive reflex that draws our attention away from the heart of an issue.</p>
	<p>-23 <strong>On storage.</strong> In the end, they are only a superficial answer.</p>
	<p>-25 <strong>On tidying by category versus location.</strong> Tidy by category, not by place.</p>
	<p>-28 <strong>Three types of people</strong>: can't throw away, can't put back, or both.</p>
	<p>-28 <strong>Two essential actions</strong>: discarding and deciding where to store things. Discarding must come first.</p>
	<p>-30 <strong>On perfection</strong>: you only have to experience a state of perfect order once to be able to maintain it.</p>
	<p>-31 <strong>On bliss</strong>: I have time to experience bliss in my quiet space, where even the air feels fresh and clean; time to sit and sip herbal tea while I reflect on my day. As I look around, my glance falls on a painting that I particularly love, purchased overseas, and a vase of fresh flowers in one corner. Although not large, the place I live is graced only with those things that speak to my heart. My lifestyle brings me joy.</p><br>
	<p>Ch. 2 Finish discarding first</p>
	<p>-34 <strong>On half-assing</strong>: The more time it takes, the more tired you feel, and the more likely you are to give up when you're only halfway through.</p>
	<p>-41 <strong>On discarding</strong>: Take each item in one's hand and ask: "Does this spark joy?" If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it.</p>
	<p>-45 <strong>On value</strong>: People have trouble discarding things that they could still use (functional value), that contain helpful information (informational value), and that have sentimental ties (emotional value). When these things are hard to obtain or replace (rarity), they become even harder to part with.</p>
	<p>-48 <strong>On family</strong>: "Don't let your family see what's here. If at all possible, take the bags out yourself. There's no need to let your family know the details of what you throw out or donate." It's extremely stressful for parents to see what their children discard. The sheer volume of the pile can make parents anxious about whether their children can survive on what's left. In addition, despite knowing that they should rejoice at their child's independence and maturity, parents can find it very painful to see clothes, toys, and mementos from the past on the rubbish heap, especially if they are things they gave to their child. Keeping your garbage out of sight is considerate. It also protects your family from acquiring more than they need or can enjoy. Up to this point, your family was perfectly content with that they had. When they see you have chosen to discard, they may feel guilty at such blatant waste, but the items they retrieve from your pile just increase the burden of unnecessary items in their home. And we should be ashamed of forcing them to carry this burden.</p>
	<p>-52 <strong>On getting family to tidy</strong>: To quietly work away at disposing of your own excess is actually the best way of dealing with a family that doesn't tidy.</p>
	<p>-53 <strong>On projecting tidiness</strong>: The urge to point out someone else's failure to tidy is usually a sign that you are neglecting to take care of your own space. This is why you should begin by discarding only your own things. You can leave the communal space to the end. The first step is to confront your own stuff.</p>
	<p>-55 <strong>On siblings and hand me downs</strong>: There are two reasons why younger sisters tend to collect clothes they don't really like. One is that it's hard to get rid of something received from family. The other is that they don't really know what they like, which makes it hard to decide whether they should part with it. Because they receive so much clothing from others, they don't really need to shop and therefore they have less opportunity to develop the instinct for what really inspires joy. "Basically, I was transferring my guilt at not being able to discard them onto her."</p>
	<p>-58 <strong>On tidying and meditation</strong>: The clear, refreshed feeling gained after standing under a waterfall can be addictive. Similarly, when you finish putting your space in order, you will be overcome with the urge to do it again. And, unlike waterfall meditation, you don't have to travel distances over hard terrain to get there. You can enjoy the same effect in your own home. That's pretty special, don't you think?</p>
	<p>-60 <strong>On things and people</strong>: Every object has a different role to play. Not all clothes have to come to you to be worn threadbare. It is the same with people. Not every person you meet in life will become a close friend or lover. Some you will find hard to get along with or impossible to like. But these people, too, teach the precious lesson of who you do like, so that you will appreciate those special people even more. When you come across something that you cannot part with, think carefully about its true purpose in your life. You'll be surprised at how many of the things you possess have already fulfilled their role, By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order, In the end, all that will remain are the things that you really treasure.</p>
	<p>-61 <strong>On letting go</strong>: To truly cherish the things that are important to you, you must first discard those that have outlived their purpose.</p><br>
	<p>Ch. 3 Tidying by category works like magic</p>
	<p>-73 <strong>On folding clothes</strong>: The act of folding clothes is far more than making clothes compact for storage. It is an act of caring, an expression of love and appreciation for the way these clothes support your lifestyle. Therefore, when we fold, we should put our heart into it, thanking our clothes for protecting our bodies.</p>
	<p>-79 <strong>On rising right</strong>: Line that slope up to the right make people feel comfortable. By using this this principle when you organize your closet, you can make the contents look far more exciting. Heavy, darker, longer on left; thinner, lighter, shorter on right.</p>
	<p>-83 <strong>On folding socks</strong>: Fold like clothes. Store the socks on edge, just as you did for clothing. You'll be amazed at how little space you need compared to your potato ball days, and you'll notice your socks breathing a sigh of relief at being untied.</p>
	<p>-88 <strong>On books</strong>: Treat books the same as clothes. Imagine what it would be like to have a bookshelf filled only with books that you really love. Isn't that image spellbinding? For someone who loves books, what greater happiness could there be?</p>
	<p>-92 <strong>On keeping unread books</strong>: If you want the book so badly after getting rid of it that you're willing to buy another copy, then buy one - and this time read and study it.</p>
	<p>-105 <strong>On komono</strong> (miscellaneous items): Too many people live surrounded by things they don't need "just because."</p>
	<p>-106 <strong>On gifts</strong>: Presents are not "things" but a means for conveying someone's feelings. When viewed from this perspective, you don't need to feel guilty for parting with a gift. Just thank it for the joy it gave you when you first received it. Of course, it would be ideal if you could use it with joy. But surely the person who gave it to you doesn't want you to use it out of a sense of obligation, or to put it away without using it, only to feel guilty every time you see it. When you discard or donate it, you do so for the sake of the giver, too.</p>
	<p>-109 <strong>On boxes</strong>: It's a shame to let a boring box take up room in your house just because you might need it someday.</p>
	<p>-110 <strong>On bedding for guests</strong>: Although it is worth having spare bedding if toy have regular guests, it's unnecessary to keep extra sets if you only have overnight visitors at most once or twice a year. Bedding stored indefinitely in the closet often smells so mildewed you wouldn't want to let your guests use it anyway. Take a whiff and see for yourself.</p>
	<p>-114 <strong>On Sentiment</strong>: No matter how wonderful things used to be, we cannot live in the past. The joy and excitement we feel here and now is more important.</p>
	<p>-117 <strong>On the past</strong>: If you just stow these things away in a drawer or cardboard box, before you realize it, your past will become a weight that holds you back and keeps you from living in the here and now. To put things in order means to put your past in order, too.</p>
	<p>-118 <strong>On memories</strong>: It is not our memories but the person we have become because of those past experience that we should treasure. This is the lesson these keepsakes teach us when we sort them. The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past.</p>
	<p>-119 <strong>On the meaning of photos</strong>: The meaning of a photo lies in the excitement and joy you feel when taking it. In many cases, the prints developed afterward have already outlived their purpose.</p>
	<p>-127 <strong>On Happiness and intuition</strong>: When we honestly confront the things we own, they evoke many emotions within us. Those feelings are real. It is these emotions that give us the energy for living. If you act on that intuition, you will be amazed at how things will begin to connect in your life and at the dramatic changes that follow. It is as if your life has been touched by magic. Putting your house in order is the magic that creates a vibrant and happy life.</p><br>
	<p>Ch. 4 Storing your things to make your life shine</p>
	<p>-143 <strong>Summary</strong>: Store everything similar in the same place or in close proximity. Don't disperse your storage space, If you follow this advice, you will find that you have created a very natural flow plan. There is no need whatsoever to consider frequency of use when designing storage space.</p>
	<p>-145 <strong>On stacking vs vertical storage</strong>: Things can be stacked forever and endlessly on top, which makes it harder to notice the increasing volume. Two, stacking is very hard on the things at the bottom and they soon become forgotten.</p>
	<p>-147 <strong>On shoeboxes</strong>: The most common item I use is an empty shoebox. I have tried all kinds of storage products, but have never found any other that is free and still surpasses the shoebox.</p>
	<p>-155 <strong>On the closet</strong>: Off-season items should be stored in the cupboard above the closet. Fold/stand clothes on the edge. Bedding should be stored on the upper shelf of the closet. The bottom space be be used to store electrical appliances. Large items that take up floor space should also be stored in the closet.</p>
	<p>-158 <strong>On bath and kitchen sinks</strong>: There is no need to keep soaps and shampoos out when we are not using them, the added exposure to heat and moisture when they aren't in use is bound to affect their quality. It is therefore my policy to keep everything out of the bath or shower. Whatever is used in the bath should be dried after used anyway, so it makes more sense to just wipe down the few items we use with our bath towel then put them in the cupboard. While this may seem like more work at first glance, it is actually less. It is much quicker and easier to clean the bath or shower without these items cluttering that space, and ther will be less slime buildup. The same is true for the kitchen sink area.</p>
	<p>-158 <strong>On sponges and seasonings</strong>: The secret is to make sure the sponge is completely dry. I dry not only my sponges but also my cutting boards, colanders, and dishes on my veranda. Sunlight is a good disinfectant, and my kitchen always looks very tidy because I don't have a dish rack. This is an excellent solution for people living on their own or for those who don't use many dishes. A counter is for preparing food, not for storing things. Counter space beside the stove is exposed to splatters of food and oil, and the seasonings kept here are usually sticky with grease. Rows of bottles in this area also make it much harder to keep clean, and the kitchen are will always be covered in a film of oil. Kitchen shelves and cupboards are usually designed to store seasonings and spices, so put them where they belong.</p>
	<p>-162 <strong>On interests and pleasures:</strong> Your room at least should be the one place where you can pursue and enjoy your interests to your heart's content. So if you like something don't hide it away. If you want to enjoy them but don't want your friends or others to know, I have a solution. Transform your closet into your own private space, one that gives you a thrill of pleasure.</p>
	<p>-164 <strong>On bulk buying</strong>: People commonly assume that it is cheaper to to buy things in bulk when on sale. But I believe that the opposite is true. If you consider the cost of storage, it is just as economical to keep these things in the store, not in your home. Moreover, if you buy and use them as you need them, they will be newer and in better conditions.</p>
	<p>-168 <strong>On visual noise</strong>: Shopping tags and labels overflow space with unnecessary information. By eliminating excess visual information that doesn't inspire joy, you can make your space much more peaceful and comfortable.</p>
	<p>-168 <strong>On appreciating possessions</strong>: Express your appreciation to every item that supported you during the day and find a place where they belong and can return to each day. Caring for possessions is the best way to motivate them to support you.</p><br>
	<p>Ch. 5 The magic of tidying dramatically transforms your life</p>
	<p>-176 <strong>On knowing ourselves</strong>: Although we can get to know ourselves better by sitting down and analyzing our characteristics or by listening to other's perspectives on us, I believe that tidying is the best way. After all, our possessions very accurately relate the history of the decisions we have made in life. Tidying is a way of taking stock that shows us what we really like.</p>
	<p>-178 <strong>On the magic of tidying</strong>: One of the magical effects of tidying is confidence in your decision-making capacity. Tidying means taking each item in your hand, asking yourself whether it sparks joy, and deciding on this basis whether or not to keep it. By repeating this process hundreds and thousands of times, we naturally hone our decision-making skills. People who lack confidence in their judgment lack confidence in themselves. I, too, once lacked confidence. What saved me was tidying.</p>
	<p>-182 <strong>On attachment to the past and fears concerning the future</strong>: When one or the other of these thought patterns makes it hard to throw things away, we can't see what we really need now, at this moment. We aren't sure what would satisfy us or what we are looking for. As a result, we increase the number of unnecessary possessions, burying ourselves both physically and mentally in superfluous things.</p>
	<p>-183 <strong>On confronting ourselves</strong>: The process of facing and selecting our possessions can be quite painful. It forces us to confront our imperfections and inadequacies and the foolish choices we made in the past. The things we own are real. They exist here and now as a result of choices made in the past by no one other than ourselves. It is dangerous to ignore them or to discard them indiscriminately as if denying the choices we made.</p>
	<p>-184 <strong>On achieving</strong>: If we have confidence in our decisions and launch enthusiastically into action without any doubts holding us back, we will be able to achieve much more.</p>
	<p>-191 <strong>On appreciating our home</strong>: When they don't feel like working and wander around the house in their birthday suit, the home accepts them just as they are. You won't find anyone more generous or welcoming than this. Tidying is our opportunity to express our appreciation to our home for all it does for us.</p>
	<p>-194 <strong>On health and cleaning</strong>: Reducing amount of stuff lets us see dust more easily which causes us to clean more often and more thoroughly. The fresher air is good for the skin, body, and mind. Cleaning involves energetic movement which would naturally contribute to losing weight and staying fit. And when our space is completely clean, we don't have to worry about tidying, so we are free to focus on the next issue that is important in our lives, relieving stress from our environment.</p>
	<p>-204 <strong>On why tidy</strong>: As for you, pour your time and passion into what brings you the most joy, your mission in life. I am convinced that putting your house in order will help you find the mission that speaks to your heart. Life truly begins after you have put your house in order.</p>
