	Here’s a tip for the do-it-yourself crowd: Go to your computer’s Start menu, and either go to “run” or just search for “cmd.” Open it up, and type in “ping [website address],” 


	Once you have the IP for a website, all you really need to do is enter it like you would a normal URL and hit enter/press go. Typing in “208.85.240.231” should bring you to the front page of AO3, for example, just as typing “174.121.194.34/dashboard” should bring you straight to your Tumblr dashboard. Since we’re obviously bracing for the worst case scenario which would involve you not being able to access the internet regularly, you should, save this list.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Hello, me here from April 17, 2019, when I complied these entries into the master site. Doing this has me reflecting on the past and boy reading all this has been an experience. I've grown a lot since 2011. The worries and failures of the past is a key theme I realize I had. I would put down things that I worried about and also blurt out things that I was thinking about. Mostly videogames from the looks of it. There is also a clear distinction in my writing that seems to get more mature as time passes. Still a lot of these entries are very immature. The entries only go up to 2014 and a lot of 2014 isn't recorded. I would like to fill in the gaps from memory as I think this would serve future me well. <br><br>
	2014 iirc was a strange time. I was changed majors, moved in with Andrew and Frank, and was trying to be a better student. There was a period of great motivation where I was studying hard and working out, convinced that I had found my calling. Professor Bach/Simons really lit a fire under my ass. That lasted for one or two quarters until I started to do art stuff because polisci wasn't my favorite thing as I learned motivate can only get you so far. I learned how to cook and live by myself but summer reared it's ugly head and I fell into the heat. I did three more quarters at uci living in a new real apartment (2014) but didn't really go out much. I was living just to live. I became somewhat depressed after a terrible illness and internal conflict with myself and roomates. <br><br>
	2015. I had dropped out this year and was depressed and anxious about failing my parents. Summer came around and I dont remember much that happened during this. A lot of videogames I'm sure. I played a lot of Guild Wars 2. Dad cut the internet sometime before fall and I got a bit suicidal and super depressed. Literally no motivation and laid around all day. I would drink a shit ton of soda and eat very little. I think the only thing that kept me living was my buddy, Chocolate. Fast forward a few months and I frequented Starbucks searching for employment. I got a job doing manual labor for Lootcrate winter 2015. There I learned the value of a dollar and what sacrifice was. <br><br>
	2016. I paid for our internet and had a job so life is good right? Nope, Chocolate disappears Feb 2, 2016 and I fall into a semi-depressed state. I don't remember much, just living and working until August 2016 when PokemonGo came out. This got me out of the house rather than play gw2 all day. I actually had a pretty good rest of the summer. I remember having fun with family before I went back to school fall 2016? Learned some HTML in Nov 2016 to start this. Then came 2017 where I have summed up in an early 2018 post.
