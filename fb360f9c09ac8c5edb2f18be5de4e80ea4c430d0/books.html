	-General tips: <ind> Get a holistic/clear view. Expect some pacifying behaviors. Expect initial nervousness. Get the person to relax first. Establish a baseline. Look for increased use of pacifiers. Ask, pause, and observe. Keep the person focused. Chatter is not truth. Stress coming in -> distancing, stress out -> pacifiers. Isolate the cause of stress. Pacifiers say so much. Look for synchrony between verbal/nonverbal. </ind>
	-Observing emphasis is important because it is universal when people are being genuine. <br>
	<blockquote>"Last, be careful not to label someone a liar with limited information or based on one observation. Many good relationships have been ruined this way." </blockquote>

	<h1 id="3">As A Man Thinketh</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	<h2> Chapter 1: Thought and Character</h2>
	Allen writes that "A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all of his thoughts. And since "...cause and effect are as absolute and undeviating in the hidden realm of thought as in the world of visible and material things," we determine (or at least heavily influence) our situation in life... essentially sleeping in the bed we have made. According to the author, "Man is made or unmade by himself" and can improve his lot in life by thinking "right" thoughts and by the right choice of the application of thought (i.e., choosing the "right" actions and behaviors). <br><br>
	<h2> Chapter 2: Effect of Thought on Circumstances</h2> 
	Allen writes that "The outer conditions of a person's life will always be found to be harmoniously related to his inner state. This does not mean that a man's circumstances at any giving time are an indication of his entire character, but that those circumstances are so intimately connected with some vital thought-element within himself that, for the time being, they are indispensable to his development." Essentially, that we are where we are based on our thoughts and our actions. Not that external factors don't have influence, but that on balance we are each the master of our own destiny. <br><br>
	<h2> Chapter 3: Effects of Thoughts on Health and Body </h2> 
	"The body is the servant of the mind. It obeys the operations of the mind, whether they be deliberately chosen or automatically expressed," Allen writes.  And that, upon the body, "habits of thought will produce their own effects, good or bad." Ever heard the saying clean body, clean mind, clean living? That's what Allen is getting at here; that "The people who live in fear of disease are the people who get it" and that "A sour face does not come by chance; it is made by sour thoughts."<br><br>
	<h2>Chapter 4: Thought and Purpose</h2>
	"They who have no central purpose in their life fall an easy prey to petty worries, fears, troubles, and self-pityings...which lead to failure, unhappiness, and loss, for weakness cannot persist in the power-evolving universe." "To put away aimlessness and weakness and to begin to think with purpose is to enter the ranks of those strong one who only recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment." "The will to do springs from the knowledge that we can do. Doubt and fear are the great enemies of knowledge, and he who encourages them, who does not slay them, thwarts himself at every step."<br><br>
	<h2>Chapter 5: The Thought-Factor in Achievement</h2>
	Allen's opening statement in this chapter: "All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts." And his ending statement: "He who would accomplish little need sacrifice little; he who would achieve much must sacrifice much. He who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly." I've always believed that, when combined with a purpose, hard work and persistence are key elements to success. You've got to be able to fight for what you believe in and be willing to sacrifice to achieve it. <br><br>
	<h2> Chapter 6: Visions and Ideals</h2> 
	"To desire is to obtain; to aspire is to achieve. Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so shall you become. Your vision is the promise of what you shall one day be; your ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil. The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream. The oak sleeps in the acorn; the bird waits in the egg. And in the highest vision of a soul a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the seedlings of realities. You will become as small as your controlling desire; as great as your dominant aspiration." <br><br>
	<h2> Chapter 7: Serenity</h2> 
	"That exquisite poise of character that we call serenity is the last lesson of culture. Calmness of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. It is the result of long and patient effort in self-control. Its presence is an indication of ripened experience, and of a more than ordinary knowledge of the laws and operations of thought. Keep your hands firmly upon the helm of thought."<br><br>

	-Alter a habit of addiction into a beneficial/pleasurable habit, one that makes you happier/healthier/wealthier. <br>
	-Habit Loop: Cue -> Routine -> Reward <br>
	-Habits take almost a year to reach the line of automaticity. Keep at it. <br>
	-Progress is not lost if you miss a day or two. Missing consecutive days is detrimental. Don't focus on numerical streaks just keep resisting urge to binge and keep going. <br><br>
	<h2>How to Properly Build Habits</h2>
	-Cue: pick something that occurs everyday at around the same time. <br>
	-Routine: focus on showing up. Set a low/high bar. <br>
	-Reward: pick something primitive/pleasurable. Food, sex, play, relaxation. <br><br>
	<h2>Willpower is like a muscle!</h2>
	-The more you use your willpower, the more tired it gets. <br>
	-When the muscle fails you reach ego depletion. <br>
	<ind><b>Ego depletion: the state where the brain is slower, prone to errors, emotions are harder to control, pain tolerance is lowered, decision making is impaired, more implusive, and temptations become stronger. </b></ind> <br>
	<h2>What Drains Willpower?</h2> 
	1. Mental Processes; thinking hard. <br>
	<ind>-Find more efficient ways to think less</ind> 
	2. Resisting Urges<br>
	<ind>-Change environment when urges appear <br>
	-Become mindful of the urge, notice it, think about noticing it, and about how it makes you feel; don't act on it.</ind>
	3. Decision Fatigue; making choices <br>
	<ind>-Implementation intention: write decisions down. </ind> 
	4. Other ways to lower willpower use: <br>
	-amount of willpower decreases as you reach line of automaticity<br>
	-learn to love your rountine; research benefits, become a fan/subscriber, surround yourself with images/people/ideas that support the habit. <br><br>
	<h2>Recharging Willpower (30% Physiological)</h2> 
	1. Eat low-glycemic foods. <br>
	2. Switch to standby mode; Go for a walk or meditate. <br>
	3. Get enough sleep. <br>
	<h2>Recharging Willpower (70% Psychological)</h2>
	1. Chunking: taking a large task ad breaking it down into tiny manageable tasks. <br>
	<ind>We have infinite willpower but brain puts limits to prevent burnout.</ind> 
	2. Confidence: more confidence/less willpower required. Repetition = confidence. <br>
	3. Change your view of willpower (mindset) <br>
	<ind> -The amount of willpower I have is infinite <br>
	-The brain likes to put limits <br>
	-Learning about willpower allows me to tap into more of my willpower </ind>
	4. Identity (identity that aligns with goals or habits you're trying to build) <br>
	-change your language/vocabulary. <br>
	-"I am not a X addict." <br>
	-Remove phrases like: "I have to.. I must.. I should.. I can't.. I will eventually.." <br>
	-Use "I want to because.." Know the reason and cling to it. <br>
	5. High-level thinking <br>
	-Spend more time thinking long term, more general, and ask why. This creates a sense of purpose and meaning
	<h2>Six Fundamental Human Needs</h2> 
	1. Certainty: basic human needs like food, shelter, security.<br>
	2. Variety: some sort of excitement; hobbies, adventure, new things/people. <br>
	3. Significance: sense of importance, that we matter, what we daydream about achieving. <br>
	4. Love/connection: deep bonds with others, improve social and conversational skills. <br>
	5. Growth: improvement in life, progress over stagnation. <br>
	6. Contribution: giving back; work on yourself so you can give back and spread happiness and in turn receive happiness. <br>

	<h1 id="7">Emotions Revealed</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	<h2>Chapter 1</h2> 

		-Expressions are universal.<br>
		-Emotion is a process, influenced by evolution and personal experience.<br>
		-There are more than ten thousand expressions; they can be categorized as: anger, fear, sadness, disgust, comtempt, surprise, and enjoyment. <br>

	<br>
	<h2>Chapter 2</h2> 
	Why do we become emotional and when do we do so?

		-Auto-appraisers trigger when something is affecting or about to affect our welfare. Going down a rollercoaster <br>
		-Reflective appraisal: when we consciously consider what is occurring, something clicks and auto-appraisers take over. Jokes/Problems<br>
		-Memory of a past emotional event. Rape/Victory/Death<br>
		-Imagination. Theorecticals. <br>
		-Talking about a past emotional trigger. Nemesis/pet/lover/traumatic event<br>
		-Empathy or by witnessing someone else's emotion reaction. Movies/books <br>
		-Other instructing us about what to be emotional about. Speeches/sermons/ACT HAPPY<br>
		-Violation of social norms. Injustice <br>
		-Voluntarily assuming the appearance of emotion sometimes brings feeling of that emotion. Fake it til you make it<br>

	<br>
	<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
	How can we control out emotions?

		There are six factors that determine how successful anyone can be in reducing the power of an emotional trigger and length of the refractory period.<br>
			1. How universally accepted the reaction to an event is. Road rage vs being criticized by boss. Both are anger triggered but one is easily suppressed. <br>
			2. How closely current triggers resemble the original situation. Getting chased by murderer vs little children.<br>
			3. How early in a person's life the trigger was learned, the earlier the trigger was learned, the harder it will be to weaken it. Being taught to fear strangers. <br>
			4. How strong the initial emotional charge was when first learned. Aggressive bullying vs mild teasing <br>
			5. How dense the experiences were, repeated episodes over a (short) period of time. Everyday vs every week. <br>
			6. How each individual reacts to emotions. Speed of response, strength of response, how long it takes for us to recover from emotional episodes. Fast, strong, and long is harder to cool off.<br>
		-Once we can recognize emotion sensations, we can think about them during and after, understanding the cause and effect of emotion helps cool it. <br>
		-Moods are different from emotions. Moods are weaker but continuous and rarely shows on the face or voice. Moods can be a result of an emotional episode. By changing emotional state we can influence mood.  <br>

	<br>
	<h2>Chapter 4</h2> 
	What is emotional behavior composed of?

		-Signals: most of our emotions have a distinctive signal that tells other how we are feeling. <br>
		-Facial expressions: the seven emotions that have distinct, universal facial expressions are sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, contempt, and happiness. <br>
		-Voice: rarely gives false emotional message, although it gives no messages at all if the person doesn't speak.<br>
		-Actions: body language.<br>
		-Physical Changes: distance, muscle tone, sweating, respiration, cardiac activity, skin temperature, and blushing.<br>
		<b>Techniques to moderate our emotional behavior: try to reappraise what is occurring and interrupt our actions, to halt our speech. It is possible to stop speech and actions but controlling the involuntary behaviour is not easy.</b>

	<br>
	<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
	How to recognize Sadness: <br>
	-By the angling upward of the inner corners of the eyebrows. <br>
	-The lips are stretched horizontally. <br>
	-The lower lip is pushed up and maybe is trembling. <br>
	-The wide open mouth adds intensity. Cheeks are raised. <br>
	-Lips conners are pulled down. <br>
	-The tip of the chin together with the lower lip is pushed upwards. <br>
	-Some people look like they are smiling in sadness but in reality the lip corners are being pulled upward by the strong action of the cheek muscle, not by the muscle that underlines smiling. <br>
	-The upper eyelids are slightly drooped. <br>
	-Narrow of eyes. <br>
	-The gazed is directed down in sadness.<br>
	We can also have a partial expression, when the signal is just in one part of the face. The eyebrows are very important, highly reliable signs of sadness. <br>
	
	<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
	How to recognize Anger: <br>
	-eyebrows are down and together, with the inner corner down toward the nose<br>
	-the upper eyelids are pushed against the lowered eyebrows<br>
	-lips are together tightly and tense<br>
	-the jaw is clenched <br>
	-teeth are exposed<br>
	-lips may be open in square or rectangular shape, or closed and pressed one against the other. The upper lip is raised and the lower one is lowered, so that the lips are narrowed. <br>
	-the red margin of the lips becomes narrower in anger, the lips become thinner. This is a very difficult action to inhibit. It is evident when a person is not yet ware of being angry. <br>
	-The heart rate increases, as does respiration. Blood pressure rises, and the face may redden.<br>
	
	<h2> Chapter 7</h2>
	How to recognize Surprise and Fear: <br>
	Surprise:<br>
	-the upper eyelids are high<br>
	-the jaw is drop open<br>
	-eyes are wide open<br><br>
	Fear:<br>
	-the upper eyelids are high<br>
	-the lower eyelids are tense<br>
	-the eyebrows are raised and drawn together<br>
	-the chin is pulled back<br>
	-the lips are stretched horizontally back toward the ears<br>
	-hands can get colder, you can breathe more deeply and rapidly, your muscles in arms and legs can feel trembling or tightening... <br>
	
	<h2> Chapter 8</h2> 
	How to recognize Disgust and Contempt <br>
	Disgust: <br>
	-upper lip is raised <br>
	-the lower lip is raised too and protruding slightly. <br>
	-the wrinkle extending from above his nostrils downward to beyond his lip corners is deep and its shape forms an inverted U.<br>
	-the cheeks are raised and the brows are lowered so that there are the crow's feet wrinkles.<br>
	-eyebrows are pulled down. <br>
	-eyelids muscles are relaxed.<br>
	<br>
	Contempt: <br>
	- upper lip is raised. <br>
	- the lower lip is raised too and protruding slightly. <br>
	- the wrinkle extending from above his nostrils downward to beyond his lip corners is deep and its shape forms an inverted U.<br>
	- the cheeks are raised and the brows are lowered so that there are the crow's feet wrinkles.<br>
	- eyebrows are pulled down. <br>
	- eyelids muscles are relaxed.<br>
	The changes in nose, mouth and lips are important, not the ones in eyes. <br>
	
	<h2> Chapter 9 </h2>
	Enjoyment: <br>
	Which are the positive emotions?<br>
	1. Sensory pleasure: there are things that feel good to touch and being touched can fell very good too. It is an open question whether the sensory pleasure are just different routes to the same emotional experience, and therefore should be considered one single emotional experience, or if we should consider them as five different emotions- visual, tactile, olfactory, auditory, gustatory pleasures. There are many different triggers, some of some universal, other different from culture to culture and experienced. Sensory pleasures are enjoyable and there are no reasons not to consider them as emotions. <br>
	2. Amusement: can vary from slight to extremely intense, while peals of laughter and even tears. <br>
	3. Excitement: arises in response to novelty or challenge. There is often a close relationship between excitement and fear. <br>
	4. Relief: it is often accompanied by a deep inhalation and exhalation of breath and it is the emotion felt when something that had strongly aroused our emotions subsides. Fear is an often precursor of relief but not always. It is not a stand alone emotion, cause it must be always preceded by some other emotion. <br>
	5. Wonder: it means being overwhelmed by something incomprehensible. It's important to separate it from fear. It is an intense, enjoyable state. Nearly everything that is incredible, incomprehensible and fascinating can be a source of wonderment. The reactions can be goose bumps, tingling on the shoulders and back of the neck, change in respiration, deep inhalations and exhalations, shaking the head. No one knows if there is a distinctive signal in face, voice or body movement for wonderment. <br>
	6. Ecstasy or bliss: state of self-transcendent rapture, achieved by some trough meditation by other through experiences in nature, and by still others a sexual experience. It is very intense. <br>
	7. Fiero: requires a difficult challenge and a very good feeling one has about oneself at the moment of accomplishment. It has helped to motivate great efforts and great achievements.<br>
	8. Gratitude: appreciation for an altruistic gift that provides benefit. When someone does something nice for you, something altruistic, we are likely to feel gratitude. It is a complicated emotion and there are major cultural differences. Ekman doubts that there is a universal gratitude signal or a unique psychological pattern of sensations that characterizes gratitude. <br>
	9. Schadenfreude: a german word to express the feeling you experience when you learn that your worst enemy has suffered; it is enjoyable even if a different kind of enjoyment than the ones we have considered so far. <br>
	10. Content: Scholars are not sure that there is a facial sign of contentment, maybe a relaxation of the facial muscles. Contentment is heard in the voice! <br>
	11. Naches: pattern of physical sensations parents feel when their child accomplishes something important, perhaps even exceeding the parents themselves. It is a yiddish word more indicate than proud. <br>
	12. Elevation: a warm, uplifting feeling that people experience when they see unexpected acts of human goodness, kindness and compassion. We become motivated with ourselves to become a better person, to engage in altruistic acts. <br>
	-Functions: these enjoyable emotions motivate our lived, they cause us to do things that by and large are good for us. They encourage us to engage in activity that is necessary for the survival of our species. They motivate our lives. <br>
	
	<h2> Chapter 10</h2>
	Takeaway: emotions depend too much on circumstances and internal thoughts. They can intermingle and be concealed so never presume anything. Say nothing about what is seen, instead be alert to the possibilities. How you respond depends on the nature of the relationship, its past history, intended future, and your knowledge of the person. Relationships work better when people understand and acknowledge how each other feels but be cautious and give room for privacy. <br><br>

	Guilt, shame, envy and embarrassment are also emotions that do not have universal expressions and are mostly concealed thereby more difficult to see. <br><br>

	<h1 id="8">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: <p style="font-size: 12px;">The Japanese art of decluttering and organizing</p></h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	<p>Ch. 1 Why can't I keep my house in order?</p>
	<p>-p10 When it comes to tidying, we are all self-taught.</p>
	<p>-p11 Food, clothing, and, shelter are the most basic humans needs, so you would think that where we live would be considered just as important as what we eat and what we wear.</p>
	<p>-p15 People cannot change their habits without first changing their way of thinking.</p>
	<p>-p17 <strong>On motivation and efforts. </strong>Even if they are initially inspired, they can't stay motivated and their efforts peter out. The root cause lies in the fact that they can't see the results or feel the effects. This is precisely why success depends on experiencing tangible results immediately. (primitive rewards)? If you use the right method and concerntrate your efforts on eliminating clutter thoroughly and completely within a short span of time, you'll see instant results that will empower you to keep your space in order ever after.</p>
	<p>-p21 <strong>On distractions and objectives</strong>. Distracted by the "need" to tidy my room, it took me so long to get down to studying that my grades were always terrible.</p>
	<p>-p21 <strong>"a messy room equals a messy mind"</strong> The act of cluttering is really an instinctive reflex that draws our attention away from the heart of an issue.</p>
	<p>-23 <strong>On storage.</strong> In the end, they are only a superficial answer.</p>
	<p>-25 <strong>On tidying by category versus location.</strong> Tidy by category, not by place.</p>
	<p>-28 <strong>Three types of people</strong>: can't throw away, can't put back, or both.</p>
	<p>-28 <strong>Two essential actions</strong>: discarding and deciding where to store things. Discarding must come first.</p>
	<p>-30 <strong>On perfection</strong>: you only have to experience a state of perfect order once to be able to maintain it.</p>
	<p>-31 <strong>On bliss</strong>: I have time to experience bliss in my quiet space, where even the air feels fresh and clean; time to sit and sip herbal tea while I reflect on my day. As I look around, my glance falls on a painting that I particularly love, purchased overseas, and a vase of fresh flowers in one corner. Although not large, the place I live is graced only with those things that speak to my heart. My lifestyle brings me joy.</p><br>
	<p>Ch. 2 Finish discarding first</p>
	<p>-34 <strong>On half-assing</strong>: The more time it takes, the more tired you feel, and the more likely you are to give up when you're only halfway through.</p>
	<p>-41 <strong>On discarding</strong>: Take each item in one's hand and ask: "Does this spark joy?" If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it.</p>
	<p>-45 <strong>On value</strong>: People have trouble discarding things that they could still use (functional value), that contain helpful information (informational value), and that have sentimental ties (emotional value). When these things are hard to obtain or replace (rarity), they become even harder to part with.</p>
	<p>-48 <strong>On family</strong>: "Don't let your family see what's here. If at all possible, take the bags out yourself. There's no need to let your family know the details of what you throw out or donate." It's extremely stressful for parents to see what their children discard. The sheer volume of the pile can make parents anxious about whether their children can survive on what's left. In addition, despite knowing that they should rejoice at their child's independence and maturity, parents can find it very painful to see clothes, toys, and mementos from the past on the rubbish heap, especially if they are things they gave to their child. Keeping your garbage out of sight is considerate. It also protects your family from acquiring more than they need or can enjoy. Up to this point, your family was perfectly content with that they had. When they see you have chosen to discard, they may feel guilty at such blatant waste, but the items they retrieve from your pile just increase the burden of unnecessary items in their home. And we should be ashamed of forcing them to carry this burden.</p>
	<p>-52 <strong>On getting family to tidy</strong>: To quietly work away at disposing of your own excess is actually the best way of dealing with a family that doesn't tidy.</p>
	<p>-53 <strong>On projecting tidiness</strong>: The urge to point out someone else's failure to tidy is usually a sign that you are neglecting to take care of your own space. This is why you should begin by discarding only your own things. You can leave the communal space to the end. The first step is to confront your own stuff.</p>
	<p>-55 <strong>On siblings and hand me downs</strong>: There are two reasons why younger sisters tend to collect clothes they don't really like. One is that it's hard to get rid of something received from family. The other is that they don't really know what they like, which makes it hard to decide whether they should part with it. Because they receive so much clothing from others, they don't really need to shop and therefore they have less opportunity to develop the instinct for what really inspires joy. "Basically, I was transferring my guilt at not being able to discard them onto her."</p>
	<p>-58 <strong>On tidying and meditation</strong>: The clear, refreshed feeling gained after standing under a waterfall can be addictive. Similarly, when you finish putting your space in order, you will be overcome with the urge to do it again. And, unlike waterfall meditation, you don't have to travel distances over hard terrain to get there. You can enjoy the same effect in your own home. That's pretty special, don't you think?</p>
	<p>-60 <strong>On things and people</strong>: Every object has a different role to play. Not all clothes have to come to you to be worn threadbare. It is the same with people. Not every person you meet in life will become a close friend or lover. Some you will find hard to get along with or impossible to like. But these people, too, teach the precious lesson of who you do like, so that you will appreciate those special people even more. When you come across something that you cannot part with, think carefully about its true purpose in your life. You'll be surprised at how many of the things you possess have already fulfilled their role, By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order, In the end, all that will remain are the things that you really treasure.</p>
	<p>-61 <strong>On letting go</strong>: To truly cherish the things that are important to you, you must first discard those that have outlived their purpose.</p><br>
	<p>Ch. 3 Tidying by category works like magic</p>
	<p>-73 <strong>On folding clothes</strong>: The act of folding clothes is far more than making clothes compact for storage. It is an act of caring, an expression of love and appreciation for the way these clothes support your lifestyle. Therefore, when we fold, we should put our heart into it, thanking our clothes for protecting our bodies.</p>
	<p>-79 <strong>On rising right</strong>: Line that slope up to the right make people feel comfortable. By using this this principle when you organize your closet, you can make the contents look far more exciting. Heavy, darker, longer on left; thinner, lighter, shorter on right.</p>
	<p>-83 <strong>On folding socks</strong>: Fold like clothes. Store the socks on edge, just as you did for clothing. You'll be amazed at how little space you need compared to your potato ball days, and you'll notice your socks breathing a sigh of relief at being untied.</p>
	<p>-88 <strong>On books</strong>: Treat books the same as clothes. Imagine what it would be like to have a bookshelf filled only with books that you really love. Isn't that image spellbinding? For someone who loves books, what greater happiness could there be?</p>
	<p>-92 <strong>On keeping unread books</strong>: If you want the book so badly after getting rid of it that you're willing to buy another copy, then buy one - and this time read and study it.</p>
	<p>-105 <strong>On komono</strong> (miscellaneous items): Too many people live surrounded by things they don't need "just because."</p>
	<p>-106 <strong>On gifts</strong>: Presents are not "things" but a means for conveying someone's feelings. When viewed from this perspective, you don't need to feel guilty for parting with a gift. Just thank it for the joy it gave you when you first received it. Of course, it would be ideal if you could use it with joy. But surely the person who gave it to you doesn't want you to use it out of a sense of obligation, or to put it away without using it, only to feel guilty every time you see it. When you discard or donate it, you do so for the sake of the giver, too.</p>
	<p>-109 <strong>On boxes</strong>: It's a shame to let a boring box take up room in your house just because you might need it someday.</p>
	<p>-110 <strong>On bedding for guests</strong>: Although it is worth having spare bedding if toy have regular guests, it's unnecessary to keep extra sets if you only have overnight visitors at most once or twice a year. Bedding stored indefinitely in the closet often smells so mildewed you wouldn't want to let your guests use it anyway. Take a whiff and see for yourself.</p>
	<p>-114 <strong>On Sentiment</strong>: No matter how wonderful things used to be, we cannot live in the past. The joy and excitement we feel here and now is more important.</p>
	<p>-117 <strong>On the past</strong>: If you just stow these things away in a drawer or cardboard box, before you realize it, your past will become a weight that holds you back and keeps you from living in the here and now. To put things in order means to put your past in order, too.</p>
	<p>-118 <strong>On memories</strong>: It is not our memories but the person we have become because of those past experience that we should treasure. This is the lesson these keepsakes teach us when we sort them. The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past.</p>
	<p>-119 <strong>On the meaning of photos</strong>: The meaning of a photo lies in the excitement and joy you feel when taking it. In many cases, the prints developed afterward have already outlived their purpose.</p>
	<p>-127 <strong>On Happiness and intuition</strong>: When we honestly confront the things we own, they evoke many emotions within us. Those feelings are real. It is these emotions that give us the energy for living. If you act on that intuition, you will be amazed at how things will begin to connect in your life and at the dramatic changes that follow. It is as if your life has been touched by magic. Putting your house in order is the magic that creates a vibrant and happy life.</p><br>
	<p>Ch. 4 Storing your things to make your life shine</p>
	<p>-143 <strong>Summary</strong>: Store everything similar in the same place or in close proximity. Don't disperse your storage space, If you follow this advice, you will find that you have created a very natural flow plan. There is no need whatsoever to consider frequency of use when designing storage space.</p>
	<p>-145 <strong>On stacking vs vertical storage</strong>: Things can be stacked forever and endlessly on top, which makes it harder to notice the increasing volume. Two, stacking is very hard on the things at the bottom and they soon become forgotten.</p>
	<p>-147 <strong>On shoeboxes</strong>: The most common item I use is an empty shoebox. I have tried all kinds of storage products, but have never found any other that is free and still surpasses the shoebox.</p>
	<p>-155 <strong>On the closet</strong>: Off-season items should be stored in the cupboard above the closet. Fold/stand clothes on the edge. Bedding should be stored on the upper shelf of the closet. The bottom space be be used to store electrical appliances. Large items that take up floor space should also be stored in the closet.</p>
	<p>-158 <strong>On bath and kitchen sinks</strong>: There is no need to keep soaps and shampoos out when we are not using them, the added exposure to heat and moisture when they aren't in use is bound to affect their quality. It is therefore my policy to keep everything out of the bath or shower. Whatever is used in the bath should be dried after used anyway, so it makes more sense to just wipe down the few items we use with our bath towel then put them in the cupboard. While this may seem like more work at first glance, it is actually less. It is much quicker and easier to clean the bath or shower without these items cluttering that space, and ther will be less slime buildup. The same is true for the kitchen sink area.</p>
	<p>-158 <strong>On sponges and seasonings</strong>: The secret is to make sure the sponge is completely dry. I dry not only my sponges but also my cutting boards, colanders, and dishes on my veranda. Sunlight is a good disinfectant, and my kitchen always looks very tidy because I don't have a dish rack. This is an excellent solution for people living on their own or for those who don't use many dishes. A counter is for preparing food, not for storing things. Counter space beside the stove is exposed to splatters of food and oil, and the seasonings kept here are usually sticky with grease. Rows of bottles in this area also make it much harder to keep clean, and the kitchen are will always be covered in a film of oil. Kitchen shelves and cupboards are usually designed to store seasonings and spices, so put them where they belong.</p>
	<p>-162 <strong>On interests and pleasures:</strong> Your room at least should be the one place where you can pursue and enjoy your interests to your heart's content. So if you like something don't hide it away. If you want to enjoy them but don't want your friends or others to know, I have a solution. Transform your closet into your own private space, one that gives you a thrill of pleasure.</p>
	<p>-164 <strong>On bulk buying</strong>: People commonly assume that it is cheaper to to buy things in bulk when on sale. But I believe that the opposite is true. If you consider the cost of storage, it is just as economical to keep these things in the store, not in your home. Moreover, if you buy and use them as you need them, they will be newer and in better conditions.</p>
	<p>-168 <strong>On visual noise</strong>: Shopping tags and labels overflow space with unnecessary information. By eliminating excess visual information that doesn't inspire joy, you can make your space much more peaceful and comfortable.</p>
	<p>-168 <strong>On appreciating possessions</strong>: Express your appreciation to every item that supported you during the day and find a place where they belong and can return to each day. Caring for possessions is the best way to motivate them to support you.</p><br>
	<p>Ch. 5 The magic of tidying dramatically transforms your life</p>
	<p>-176 <strong>On knowing ourselves</strong>: Although we can get to know ourselves better by sitting down and analyzing our characteristics or by listening to other's perspectives on us, I believe that tidying is the best way. After all, our possessions very accurately relate the history of the decisions we have made in life. Tidying is a way of taking stock that shows us what we really like.</p>
	<p>-178 <strong>On the magic of tidying</strong>: One of the magical effects of tidying is confidence in your decision-making capacity. Tidying means taking each item in your hand, asking yourself whether it sparks joy, and deciding on this basis whether or not to keep it. By repeating this process hundreds and thousands of times, we naturally hone our decision-making skills. People who lack confidence in their judgment lack confidence in themselves. I, too, once lacked confidence. What saved me was tidying.</p>
	<p>-182 <strong>On attachment to the past and fears concerning the future</strong>: When one or the other of these thought patterns makes it hard to throw things away, we can't see what we really need now, at this moment. We aren't sure what would satisfy us or what we are looking for. As a result, we increase the number of unnecessary possessions, burying ourselves both physically and mentally in superfluous things.</p>
	<p>-183 <strong>On confronting ourselves</strong>: The process of facing and selecting our possessions can be quite painful. It forces us to confront our imperfections and inadequacies and the foolish choices we made in the past. The things we own are real. They exist here and now as a result of choices made in the past by no one other than ourselves. It is dangerous to ignore them or to discard them indiscriminately as if denying the choices we made.</p>
	<p>-184 <strong>On achieving</strong>: If we have confidence in our decisions and launch enthusiastically into action without any doubts holding us back, we will be able to achieve much more.</p>
	<p>-191 <strong>On appreciating our home</strong>: When they don't feel like working and wander around the house in their birthday suit, the home accepts them just as they are. You won't find anyone more generous or welcoming than this. Tidying is our opportunity to express our appreciation to our home for all it does for us.</p>
	<p>-194 <strong>On health and cleaning</strong>: Reducing amount of stuff lets us see dust more easily which causes us to clean more often and more thoroughly. The fresher air is good for the skin, body, and mind. Cleaning involves energetic movement which would naturally contribute to losing weight and staying fit. And when our space is completely clean, we don't have to worry about tidying, so we are free to focus on the next issue that is important in our lives, relieving stress from our environment.</p>
	<p>-204 <strong>On why tidy</strong>: As for you, pour your time and passion into what brings you the most joy, your mission in life. I am convinced that putting your house in order will help you find the mission that speaks to your heart. Life truly begins after you have put your house in order.</p>

	<h1 id="9">The Power of Habit<p style="font-size: 12px;">Why We Do What We Do In Life And Business</p></h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	<p><strong>-50 On habits and cravings:</strong> But to overpower the habit, we must recognize which craving is driving the behavior. If we're not conscious of the anticipation, then we're like the shoppers who wander, as if drawn by an unseen force, into Cinnabon. <br /><strong>-51 On cue triggers:</strong> But countless studies have shown that a cue and a reward, on their own, aren't enough for anew habit to last. Only when your brain starts expecting the reward--craving the endorphins or sense of accomplishment--will it become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. The cue, in addition to triggering a routine, must also trigger a craving for the reward to come. <br /><strong>-59 On the importance of cravings:</strong> Cravings are what drive habits. And figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier. It's as true now as it was almost a century ago. Every night, millions of people scrub their teeth in order to get a tingling feeling; every morning, millions put on their jogging shoes to capture an endorphin rush they've learned to crave. <br /><strong>-62 On changing habits:</strong> Rather, to change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. That's the rule: If you use the same cue, and provide the same reward, you can shift the routine and change the habit.Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same. <br /><strong>-85 On belief:</strong> It wasn't God that mattered, the researchers figured out. It was belief itself that made a difference. Once people learned how to believe in something, that skill started spilling over to other parts of their lives, until they started believing they could change. Belief was the ingredient that made a reworked habit loop into a permanent behavior. <br /><strong>-89 On belief and community:</strong> But we do do know that for habits to permanently change, people must believe that change is feasible. The same process that makes AA so effective--the power of a group to teach individuals how to believe--happens whenever people come together to help one another change. Belief is easier when it occurs within a community. <br /><strong>-92 On chapter 3:</strong> The evidence is clear: If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group. Belief is essential, and it grows out of a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people. <br /><strong>-109 On keystone habits and structure:</strong> Studies have documented that families who habitually eat dinner together seem to raise children with better homework skills, higher grades, greater emotional control, and more confidence. Making your bed every morning is correlated with better productivity, a greater sense of well-being, and stronger skills at sticking with a budget. It's not that a family meal or a tidy bed causes better grades or less frivolous spending. But somehow those initial shifts start chain reactions that help other good habits takes hold...Keystone habits offer what is known within academic literature as "small wins." They help other habits to flourish by creating new structures, and they establish cultures where change becomes contagious. <br /><strong>-112-113 On small wins:</strong> "Small wins are a steady application of a small advantage. Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win." Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach. <br /><strong>-124 On "grit":</strong> the tendency to work "strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest over years despite failure, adversity, and plateaus in progress." Cadets who are successful at West Point arrive at the school armed with habits of mental and physical discipline. Those assets, however only carry you so far. To succeed, they need a keystone habit that creates a culture--such as a daily gathering of like-minded friends--to help find the strength to overcome obstacles. Keystone habits transform us by creating cultures that make clear the values that, in the heat of a difficult decision or a moment of uncertainty, we might otherwise forget. <br /><strong>-151 On personal reasons:</strong> When people are asked to do something that takes self-control, if they think they are doing it for personal reasons--if they feel like it's a choice or something they enjoy because it helps someone else--it's much less taxing. If they feel like they have no autonomy, if they're just following order, their willpower muscles get tired much faster. In both cases, people ignored the cookies. But when the students were treated like cogs, rather than people, it took a lot more willpower.<br /><strong>-180 On crisis:</strong> A company with dysfunctional habits can't turn around simply because a leader orders it. Rather, wise executives seek out moments of crisis--or create the perception of crisis--and cultivate the sense that something must change, until everyone is finally ready to overhaul the patterns they live with each day. <br /><strong>-189 On Target guest ids:</strong> The company will guess what you habitually buy, and then try to convince you to get it at Target. The firm has the capacity to personalize the ads and coupons it sends to every customer, even though you'll probably never realize you've received a different flyer in the mail than your neighbors. "With the Guest ID, we have your name, address, and tender, we know you've got a Target Visa, a debit card, and we can tie that to your store purchases." <br /><strong>-210 On camouflage and familiarity:</strong> Target started sandwiching the diaper coupons between nonpregnancy products that made the advertisements seem anonymous, familiar, comfortable. They camouflaged what they knew. If you dress a new something in old habits, it's easier for the public to accept it. <br /><strong>-219 On socials habits and Rosa Parks:</strong> Rosa Parks, unlike other people who had been jailed for violating the bus segregation law, was deeply respected and embedded within her community. So when she was arrested, it triggered a series of social habits--the habits of friendship--that ignited an initial protest. Park's friends spanned Montogomery's social and economic hierarchies. She had what sociologists call "strong ties"--firsthand relationships--with dozens of groups throughout Montgomery that didn't usually come into contact with one another. Rosa Parks transcended the social stratifications of the black community and Montgomery as a whole. She was friends with field hands and college professors. And the power of those friendships became apparent as soon as Parks landed in jail. <br /><strong>-222 On social peer pressure:</strong> The Montgomery bus boycott became a society-wide action because the sense of obligation that held the black community together was activated soon after Park's friends started spreading the word. People who hardly knew Rosa Parks decided to participate because of a social peer pressure--an influence known as "the power of weak ties"--that made it difficult to avoid joining in. <br /><strong>-225 On the habits of peer pressure:</strong> The habits of peer pressure have something in common. They often spread through weak ties. And they gain their authority through communal expectations. If you ignore the social obligations of your neighborhood, if you shrug off the expected patterns of you community, you risk losing your social standing. You endanger your access to many of the social benefits that come from joining the country club, alumni association, or the church in the first place. <br /><strong>-244 On how movements emerge:</strong> Movements don't emerge because everyone decides to face the same direction at once. They rely on social patterns that begins as the habits of friendship, grow through the habits of communities, and are sustained by new habits that change participants' sense of self. <br /><strong>-261 On the dangers of gambling:</strong> ...predictive algorithms that studied gamblers' habits and tried to figure out how to persuade them to spend more. The company assigned players a "predicted lifetime value," and software built calendars that anticipate how often they would visit and how much they would spend. The company tacked customers through loyalty cards and mailed out coupons for free meals and cash vouchers; telemarketers called people at home to ask where they had been. Casino employees were trained to encourage visitors to discuss their lives, in the hopes they might reveal information that could be used to predict how much they had to gamble with. One Harrah's executive called this approach "Pavlovian marketing." The company ran thousands of tests each year to perfect their methods. Customer tracking had increased the company's profits by billions of dollars, and was so precise they could track a gambler's spending to the cent and minute.<br /><strong>-270 On the power of habit:</strong> However, to modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You must consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habits' routines, and find alternatives. you must know you have control and be self-conscious enough to use it--and every chapter in this book is devoted to illustrating a different aspect of why that control is real...Brian Thomas should go free because Thomas never knew the patterns that drive him to kill existed in the first place--much less that he could master them. Bachmann, on the other hand, was aware of her habits. And once you know a habit exists, you have the responsibility to change it. If she had tried a bit harder, perhaps she could have reined them in. Others have done so, even in the face of greater temptations...But almost all the other patterns that exist in most people's lives--how we eat and sleep and talk to our kids, how we unthinkingly spend our time, attention, and money--those are habits that we know exist. And once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom--and the responsibility--to remake them. Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habits becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work. <br /><strong>-272 On William James:</strong> Later, he would famously write that the will to believe is the most important ingredient in creating belief in change. And that one of the most important methods for creating that belief was habits. Habits, he noted, are what allow us to "do a thing with difficulty the first time, but soon do it more and more easily, and finally, with sufficient practice, do it semi-mechanically, or with hardly any consciousness at all." Once we choose who we want to be, people grow "to the way in which they have been exercised, just as a sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever afterward into the same identical folds."</p>

	<h1 id="10">No More Mr. Nice Guy<p style="font-size: 12px;">A Proven Plan for Getting What You Want In Love, Sex, and Life</p></h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	<p><strong>-12 On not so nice traits:</strong> Nice Guys are dishonest. These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people want to hear, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest.</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys are secretive. Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, "If at first you don't succeed, hide the evidence."</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys are compartmentalized. Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina.</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys are manipulative. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys are controlling. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys give to get . Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has unconscious and unspoken strings attached. They want to be appreciated, they want some kind of reciprocation, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc. Nice Guys often report feeling frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys are passive-aggressive. Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.</p>
	<p>Nice Guys are full of rage. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times.</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys are addictive. Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere. One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness.</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries. Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying "no," "stop," or "I'm going to." They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the problems they are experiencing.</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys are frequently isolated. Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them.</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing. This behavior is often the result of the Nice Guy's childhood conditioning, his need to look good, or his quest for approval. Unfortunately, this tendency pretty much guarantees that Nice Guys will spend most of their time putting out fires and managing crises.</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships. Though Nice Guys often put tremendous emphasis on this part of their lives, their intimate relationships are frequently a source of struggle and frustration. For example: l Nice Guys are often terrible listeners because they are too busy trying to figure out how to defend themselves or fix the other person's problem. l Because of their fear of conflict, they are frequently dishonest and are rarely available to work all the way through a problem. l It is not unusual for Nice Guys to form relationships with partners whom they believe to be "projects" or "diamonds in the rough." When these projects don't polish up as expected, Nice Guys tend to blame their partner for standing in the way of their happiness.</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys have issues with sexuality. Though most Nice Guys deny having problems with sex, I have yet to meet one who isn't either dissatisfied with his sex life, has a sexual dysfunction (can't get or maintain an erection, climaxes too quickly), or has sexually acted out (through affairs, prostitution, pornography, compulsive masturbation, etc.).</p>
	<p><br />Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful. The majority of Nice Guys I've met have been talented, intelligent, and moderately successful. Almost without exception though, they fail to live up to their full potential.</p>
	<p><br /><strong>-16 On the integrated male:</strong> The process of breaking free from ineffective Nice Guy patterns doesn't involve becoming "not nice." Rather, it means becoming "integrated." Being integrated means being able to accept all aspects of one's self. An integrated man is able to embrace everything that makes him uniquely male: his power, his assertiveness, his courage, and his passion as well as his imperfections, his mistakes, and his dark side. <br /><strong>-16 On the Nice Guy Paradigm:</strong> The working paradigm of the Nice Guy is this: IF I can hide my flaws and become what I think others want me to be THEN I will be loved, get my needs met, and have a problem-free life. Even when this paradigm is ineffective, Nice Guys only see one alternative: try harder. <br /><strong>-30 On the life script:</strong> It is this paradigm, formed in childhood, that guides and controls everything Nice Guys do in their adult lives. Even though it is based on faulty interpretations of childhood events, it is the only road map these men have. Nice Guys believe this map is accurate, and if they follow it correctly, they should arrive at their desired location &mdash; a smooth, happy life. Even though this life script is often highly ineffective, Nice Guys frequently just keep trying harder, doing more of the same, hoping for different results. <br /><strong>-32-33 On historical context:</strong> <br />The transition from an agrarian to an industrial economy.<br />The movement of families from rural areas to urban areas. <br />The absence of fathers from the home.<br />The increase in divorce, single parent homes, and homes headed by women. <br />An educational system dominated by women. <br />Women's liberation and feminism.<br />The Vietnam War. <br />The sexual revolution. <br />These events combined to have a major impact on American boys growing up in this era. These social changes created three profound dynamics that contributed to the wide spread phenomena of the Nice Guy Syndrome in the baby boom generation. <br />1) Boys were separated from their fathers and other significant male role models. As a result, men became disconnected from other men in general and confused as to what it meant to be male. <br />2) Boys were left to be raised by women. The job of turning boys into men was left to mothers and a school system dominated by women. As a result, men became comfortable being defined by women and became dependent on the approval of women. <br />3) Radical feminism implied that men were bad and/or unnecessary. The messages of radical feminism furthered the belief of many men that if they wanted to be loved and get their needs met, they had to become what they believed women wanted them to be. For many men, this meant trying to hide any traits that might cause them to be labeled as "bad" men. <br /><strong>-36 On soft males:</strong> These social events further amplified the belief that if they wanted to be loved, get their needs met, and have a smooth life, they had to hide their flaws and become what others (especially women) wanted them to be. <br /><strong>-36-37 On habits of ineffective men:</strong> Seeking the approval of others. <br />Trying to hide their perceived flaws and mistakes. <br />Putting other people's needs and wants before their own. <br />Sacrificing their personal power and playing the role of a victim. <br />Disassociating themselves from other men and their own masculine energy. <br />Co-creating relationships that are less than satisfying. <br />Creating situations in which they do not have very much good sex. <br />Failing to live up their full potential. <br /><strong>-40 On Seeking approval:</strong> Nice Guys seek external validation in just about every social situation, but their quest for approval is the most pronounced in their relationships with women. Nice Guys interpret a woman's approval as the ultimate validation of their worth. Signs of a woman's approval can take the form of her desire to have sex, flirtatious behavior, a smile, a touch, or attentiveness. At the other end of the spectrum, if a woman is depressed, in a bad mood, or angry, Nice Guys interpret these things to mean that she is not accepting or approving of them. <br /><strong>-44 On Walls and Teflon Men:</strong> As much as Nice Guys try to look good and get people to like them, the above defenses keep people at arm's length. Like most Nice Guy patterns, these unconscious behaviors actually accomplish the exact opposite of what the Nice Guy really craves. While desiring love and connection, his behaviors serve as an invisible force field that keeps people from being able to get close to him. Nice Guys have a difficult time comprehending that in general, people are not drawn to perfection in others. People are drawn to shared interests, shared problems, and an individual's life energy. Humans connect with humans. Hiding one's humanity and trying to project an image of perfection makes a person vague, slippery, lifeless, and uninteresting. I often refer to Nice Guys as Teflon Men. They work so hard to be smooth, nothing can stick to them. Unfortunately, this Teflon coating also makes it difficult for people to get close. It is actually a person's rough edges and human imperfections that give others something to connect with.<br /><strong>-48 On affirmations:</strong> "I am lovable just as I am." "I am perfectly imperfect." "My needs are important." "I am a strong and powerful person." "I can handle it." "People love and accept me just as I am." "It is OK to be human and make mistakes." "I am the only person I have to please." <br />-<strong>52 On shedding old skin:</strong> They are not bad. They don't have to do anything to win other people's approval. They don't have to hide their perceived flaws or mistakes. People can love them just as they are. <br /><strong>-62 On Putting themselves first:</strong> I then list the benefits for Nice Guys and the people around them when they begin to put themselves first: l They increase the likelihood of getting what they need and want. l They can give judiciously &mdash; giving what people really need. l They can give without resentment and expectation. l They become less needy. l They become more attractive. Most Nice Guys will really like the last benefit on the list. Helpless, whiny, wimpy, and needy are not attractive on a man. Confidence and self-assurance are. Most folks are attracted to men who have a sense of self. Putting the self first doesn't drive people away, it attracts them. Putting the self first is essential for getting what one wants in love and life. <br /><strong>-66 On responsibility for one's own needs:</strong> Nice Guys have believed a myth that promises them that if they give up themselves and put others first, they will be loved and get their needs met. There is only one way to change this illogical, nonproductive Nice Guy paradigm &mdash; putting themselves first. Making the decision to put the self first is the hardest part. Actually doing it is relatively easy. When the Nice Guy puts himself first there is only one voice to consider &mdash; his own. Decisions are now made by one individual, rather than by a committee. He no longer has to mind read, predict, or try to please multiple voices with conflicting agendas. When putting himself first all the information he needs to make a decision is within him: "Is this what I want? Yes. Then that's what I'll do."<br /><strong>-70 On personal power and fear:</strong> I define personal power as a state of mind in which a person is confident he can handle whatever may come. This kind of power not only successfully deals with problems, challenges and adversity, it actually welcomes them, meets them head on, and is thankful for them. Personal power isn't the absence of fear. Even the most powerful people have fear. Personal power is the result of feeling fear, but not giving in to the fear. There is a solution to the helplessness and vulnerability Nice Guys feel. Recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome allows Nice Guys to embrace the personal power that is their birthright. Reclaiming personal power includes: l Surrendering. l Dwelling in reality. l Expressing feelings. l Facing fears. l Developing integrity.<br />l Setting boundaries. <br /><strong>-74 On feelings won't kill you:</strong> I frequently tell Nice Guys, "Your feelings are just feelings, they won't kill you." Regardless of whether a Nice Guy is feeling anxious, helpless, shameful, lonely, rageful, or sad, his feelings aren't life-threatening. <br />The goal of teaching Nice Guys to embrace their feelings is not to make them soft and "touchy-feely." Men who are in touch with their feelings are powerful, assertive, and energized. Contrary to what many Nice Guys believe, they don't have to become more like women in order to have their feelings. This is why I support men in learning about their feelings from other men. <br />Feelings are an integral part of human existence. By learning the language of feelings, recovering Nice Guys can begin to let go of a lifetime of unnecessary baggage. As they do, they experience a newfound energy, optimism, intimacy, and zest for life. <br /><strong>-78 On overcoming memory fear:</strong> Facing present day fears is the only way to overcome memory fear. Every time the Nice Guy confronts a fear, he unconsciously creates a belief that he can handle whatever it is he is afraid of. This challenges his memory fear. Challenging this memory fear makes the things outside of him seem less threatening. As these things seem less frightening, he feels more confident in confronting them. The more this confidence grows, the less threatening life seems.<br /><strong>-78 On truth and integrity:</strong> Developing integrity is an essential part of recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome. My definition of integrity is "deciding what feels right and doing it." The alternative is using the "committee approach." This method of decision-making and acting is based on trying to guess what everyone else would think is right. Following this committee approach is the quickest path to confusion, fear, powerlessness, and dishonesty. When applying the definition above, there are two ways to be out of integrity, but only one way to be in it. When a Nice Guy never even bothers to ask himself, "What do I think is right?" or uses the committee method, he will always be out of integrity. If he asks himself what he believes is right but doesn't do it, he is also out of integrity. Only by asking himself what he believes is right and then doing it does he become a man of integrity.<br /><strong>-82 On merrygoround vs rollcoaster:</strong> As recovering Nice Guys begin to surrender, dwell in reality, express their feelings, face their fears, develop integrity, and set boundaries, they access a power that allows them to welcome and embrace the challenges and "gifts" of life. Life isn't a merry-go-round, it's a roller coaster. As they reclaim personal power, recovering Nice Guys can experience the world in all of its serendipitous beauty. Life won't always be smooth, it may not always be pretty, but it will be an adventure &mdash; one not to be missed.<br /><strong>-85 On masculinity and leadership:</strong> One of the most visible consequences of the repression of masculine energy in Nice Guys is their lack of leadership in their families. Out of fear of upsetting their girlfriend or wife, or appearing too much like their controlling, authoritarian, or abusive fathers, Nice Guys frequently fail to be the leader their family needs. Consequently, the job of leading the family often falls on their wives. Most of the women I talk to don't want this job, but end up taking it by default. <br /><strong>-87 On reclaiming masculinity:</strong> l Connecting with other men. l Getting strong. l Finding healthy male role models. l Reexamining one's relationship with one's father. <br /><strong>-95 On masculinity and the next generation:</strong> I believe recovering Nice Guys can help boys find a saner model of what it means to be male in our culture. This is because there are certain things that boys can only learn from men. As Nice Guys embrace their masculinity, they can teach their sons what it means to be male. This includes how to handle their aggression, how to handle their libido, how to relate to women, how to bond with a man, and perhaps most importantly, how to embrace their own masculinity. Men teach these lessons both by example and by interaction with young boys.<br />This reciprocal process requires time and interaction. Fathers need to take their sons hunting and fishing, work on cars with them, take them to work, coach their teams, take them to ball games, work out with them, take them on business trips, and let them tag along with them when they go out with the guys. All of these activities help boys move successfully into the male world. <br /><strong>-100 On difficulty with love:</strong> l Their toxic shame. l The dysfunctional relationships they co-create. l Their patterns of enmeshment and avoidance. l The familiar childhood relationship dynamics they recreate. l Their unconscious need to remain monogamous to their mother. l They are "bad enders". <br /><strong>-104 On strategies for successful relationships:</strong> l Approve of themselves. l Put themselves first. l Reveal themselves to safe people. l Eliminate covert contracts. l Take responsibility for their own needs. l Surrender. l Dwell in reality. l Express their feelings. l Develop integrity. l Set boundaries. l Embrace their masculinity. <br /><strong>-111 On traits to look for in relationships:</strong> l Passion. l Integrity. l Happiness. l Intelligence. l Sexual assertiveness. l Financial responsibility. l Commitment to personal growth. <br /><strong>-111-112 On sex and relationships:</strong> Doing something different also means refraining from being sexual in new relationships. Nice Guys must give themselves a chance to accurately evaluate the traits listed above by staying out of bed with a person until they really get to know her. Once the sex begins in relationships, the learning stops. Sex creates such a powerful bond that it is difficult to accurately evaluate the appropriateness of a new relationship. Nice Guys may often be aware of various traits or behaviors they find unacceptable in a new partner, but if they are already having sex, it is difficult to address these issues and even tougher to end the relationship. <br /><strong>-117-118 On nice guys and dark secrets:</strong> I have found Nice Guys to be prone to hidden, compulsive sexual behavior. I have developed a theory that states, the nicer the guy, the darker the sexual secrets. I find this to be consistently true. Sex is a basic human drive. Because most Nice Guys believe they are bad for being sexual, or believe that other people will think they are bad, sexual impulses have to be kept hidden from view. The Nice Guy's sexuality doesn't go away, it just goes underground. Therefore, the more dependent a man is on external approval, the deeper he is going to have to hide his sexual behavior.<br /><strong>-124 On pornography:</strong> I am not opposed to pornography legally or morally, but I think it is bad for men for several reasons: l Pornography creates unrealistic expectations of what people should like and what sex should be like. l Pornography addicts men to bodies and body parts. l Pornography can easily become a substitute for a real sexual relationship. l Pornography creates a trance in which men can be sexual while staying distracted from their shame and fear. l Pornography compounds shame because it is usually hidden and used in secret. <br /><strong>-128 On sexual moratorium:</strong> A sexual moratorium can have many benefits: l Helps break dysfunction cycles. l Eliminates pursuing and distancing. l Releases resentment. l Allows the Nice Guy to see that he can live without sex. l Helps the Nice Guy realize that no one else but him holds the key to his sexual experience. l Helps the Nice Guy see how he settles for bad sex. l Eliminates fear that the Nice Guy's partner can withhold sex or approval. l Helps the Nice Guy pay attention to the meaning of sexual impulses. Whenever the Nice Guy feels the impulse to be sexual, he can automatically ask himself, "Why am I feeling sexual?" l Helps break addictive patterns by eliminating compulsive masturbation, pornography, and other addictive behaviors. l Helps the Nice Guy begin to address feelings he has been avoiding with sex. <br /><strong>-129 On self-confidence and a force of nature:</strong> The very thing that makes sex so exciting is exactly what makes it so terrifying. Sex is powerful, chaotic, and wild. It crackles with cosmic energy. It draws us like a moth to a flame. As recovering Nice Guys release their sexual shame and fear, take responsibility for their own pleasure, refuse to settle for bad sex, and practice being just who they are, they put themselves in the position to embrace this cosmic force without fear or reservation. This is when the sex really gets good.<br /><strong>-131 On reasons why nice guys don't have what they want in life:</strong> Fear l Trying to do it right l Trying to do everything themselves l Self-sabotage l A distorted self-image l Deprivation thinking l Staying stuck in familiar but dysfunctional systems <br /><strong>-140 On conscious decisions:</strong> For a while, I accepted this logic until it dawned on me that the life I was living had nothing to do with luck. Earning a Ph.D. involved a conscious decision, persistence, and hard work &mdash; not luck. Building a counseling practice involved facing fears, quitting a secure, well-paying job, making sacrifices, working a second job to pay bills, learning by trial and error, and a living through a period of poverty &mdash; not luck. Developing my skills as a therapist involved a commitment to personal growth, constant evolution, and a financial investment in my own therapeutic process &mdash; not luck. Writing a book, building a website, and getting published required persistence and the confrontation of numerous fears &mdash; not luck. I'm not anything special. I'm an ordinary guy with ordinary talents. I have many of the same fears as the Nice Guys with whom I work. I don't have any special talent or skill that the majority of my clients don't have. <br />What's the difference? l A conscious decision to face fears. l A conscious decision to not settle for mediocrity. l A conscious decision to make my own rules. Think about the people you respect or look up to. Most probably started with nothing but still found ways to create interesting, productive, and passionate lives. These people charted their own paths and made their own rules. What makes them different? Most are just ordinary people who took charge of their lives. Here's the good news &mdash; if they can do it, so can you. One of my favorite affirmations is, What one man can do, another man can do. Think about it &mdash; if others have taken charge and created lives worth emulating, so can you. The only thing stopping you from having the kind of life you really want is you. It is time to start charting your own path, making your own rules, and making your dreams a reality.<br /><strong>-144 On help from people:</strong> Start looking for opportunities to ask these people for help. Build networks. Before asking for help, repeat the affirmation: This person wants to help me get my needs met. <br /><strong>-146 On excuses:</strong> One way of doing this is by changing the way they think about change. This begins with Nice Guys becoming aware of why they unconsciously create so many barriers that keep them feeling stuck. A mortgage, a wife, a lack of a degree, debt, children &mdash; are all just excuses. Making significant life changes doesn't require chucking all these things. It means seeing them for what they really are &mdash; excuses &mdash; and taking small steps in the direction one wants to be going.<br /><strong>-147-148 On abundance:</strong> When we come to see the world as a place of abundance we come to realize that there is plenty for everyone. Everything we need is flowing by us &mdash; all we have to do is get out of the way of our own small thinking and let it come. Look around at the wealth &mdash; the cars people drive, the houses they live in, the trips they take. You can't argue with the sheer material abundance that can be created in our world. If other people are living full, abundant lives, why not you? Remember, what one man can do another man can do. <br /><strong>-150 On 30 rules:</strong> 1 If it frightens you, do it. <br />2 Don't settle. Every time you settle, you get exactly what you settled for. 3 Put yourself first. 4 No matter what happens, you will handle it. 5 Whatever you do, do it 100%. 6 If you do what you have always done, you will get what you have always got. 7 You are the only person on this planet responsible for your needs, wants, and happiness. 8 Ask for what you want. 9 If what you are doing isn't working, try something different. 10 Be clear and direct. 11 Learn to say "no." 12 Don't make excuses. 13 If you are an adult, you are old enough to make your own rules. 14 Let people help you. 15 Be honest with yourself. 16 Do not let anyone treat you badly. No one. Ever. 17 Remove yourself from a bad situation instead of waiting for the situation to change. 18 Don't tolerate the intolerable &mdash; ever. 19 Stop blaming. Victims never succeed. 20 Live with integrity. Decide what feels right to you, then do it. 21 Accept the consequences of your actions. <br />22 Be good to yourself. 23 Think "abundance." 24 Face difficult situations and conflict head on. 25 Don't do anything in secret. 26 Do it now. 27 Be willing to let go of what you have so you can get what you want. 28 Have fun. If you are not having fun, something is wrong. 29 Give yourself room to fail. There are no mistakes, only learning experiences. 30 Control is an illusion. Let go; let life happen.</p>

	<h1 id="11">12 Rules for Life<p style="font-size: 12px;">An Antidote to Chaos</p></h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	<p>-Foreward<br />-xi On higher education and mid-westerners (Jordan Peterson): I found them often self-educated and go to university against the odds. I found them quite unlike their sophisticated but somewhere denatured urban counterparts, for whom higher education was pre-ordained, and for that reason sometimes taken for granted, or thought of not as an end in itself but simply as a life stage in the service of career advancement. These Westerners were different: self-made, unentitled , hands on, neighbourly and less precious than many if their big-city peers, who increasingly spend their lives indoors, manipulating symbols on computers. This cowboy psychologist seemed to care about a thought only if it might, in some way, be helpful to someone. <br />-xiv On ideologies and ideologues: Ideologies are substitutes for true knowledge, and ideologues are always dangerous when they come to power, because a simple-minded I-know-it-all approach is no match for the complexity of existence. Furthermore, when their social contraptions fail to fly, ideologues blame not themselves but all who see through the simplifications. (Soviet Union Cold War). <br />-xvi On the elephant in the room: Above all, he alerted his students to topics rarely discussed in university, such as the simple fact that all the ancients, from Buddha to the biblical authors, knew what every slightly worn-out adult knows, that life is suffering. If you are suffering or someone close to you is, that's sad. But alas, it's not particularly special. We don't suffer only because "politician's are dimwitted," or "the system is corrupt," or because you and I, like almost everyone else, can legitimately describe ourselves, in some way, as a victim of something or someone. It is because we are born human that we are guaranteed a good dose of suffering. <br />-xvii On talking about suffering: Perhaps because the adults in their lives had become so naively overprotective that they deluded themselves into thinking that not talking about suffering would in some way magically protect their children from it. <br />-xviii On contradictory ideas on morality and this generation: In the West at least... They are, I believe, the first generation to have been so thoroughly taught two seemingly contradictory ideas about morality, simultaneously--at their schools, colleges, and universities, by many in my own generation. This contradiction has left them at times disoriented and uncertain, without guidance and, more tragically, deprived of riches they don't even know exist. The contradiction: morality is relative there is no true right or wrong yet we are also taught ideologies that claim to have the answers. Ideologues are often hyper-judgemental and censorious, always knows what's wrong about others, and what to do about it. Sometimes it seems the only people willing to give advice in a relativistic society are those with the least to offer. <br />-xxiv On the meaning of life: But if it's uncertain that our ideas are attainable, why do we bother reaching in the first place? Because if you don't reach for them, it is certain you will never feel that your life has meaning. And perhaps because, as unfamiliar and strange as it sounds, in the deepest part of our psyche, we all want to be judged. <br />-xxxiiv On the 12 Rules for Life: "There" is the dividing line between order and chaos. That's where we are simultaneously stable enough, exploring enough, transforming enough, repairing enough, and cooperating enough. It's there we find the meaning that justifies life and its inevitable suffering. Perhaps, if we lived properly, we would be able to tolerate the weight of our own self-consciousness. Perhaps, if we lived properly, we could withstand the knowledge of our own fragility and mortality, without the sense of aggrieved victimhood that produces, first, resentment, then envy, and then the desire for vengeance and destruction. Perhaps, if we lived properly, we wouldn't have to turn to totalitarian certainty to shield ourselves from the knowledge of our own insufficiency and ignorance. Perhaps we could come to avoid those pathways to Hell--and we have seen in the terrible twentieth century just how real Hell can be. <br />-11 On lobsters and time: First, we know that lobsters have been around, in one form or another, for more than 350 million years. This is a very long time. Sixty-five million years ago, there were still dinosaurs. That is the unimaginably distant past to us. To the lobsters, however, dinosaurs were the nouveau riche, who appeared and disappeared in the flow of near-eternal time. This means that dominance hierarchies have been an essentially permanent feature of the environment to which all complex life has adapted. A third of a billion years ago, brains and nervous systems were comparatively simple. Nonetheless, they already had the structure and neurochemistry necessary to process information about status and society. The importance of this fact can hardly be overstated. <br />-14 On dominance hierarchies: All that matters, from a Darwinian perspective, is permanence--and the dominance hierarchy is not capitalism. It's not communism, either, for that matter. It's not the military-industrial complex. It's not the patriarchy--that disposable, malleable, arbitrary cultural artefact. It's not even a human creation; not in the most profound sense. It is instead a near-eternal aspect of the environment, and much of what is blamed on these more ephemeral manifestations is a consequence of it unchanging existence. We (the sovereign we, the we that has been around since the beginning of life) have lived in a dominance hierarchy for a long, long time. We were struggling for position before we had skin, or hands, or lungs, or bones. There is little more natural than cultural. Dominance hierarchies are older than trees. <br />-17 On the primal impulse: The ancient counter will even shut down your immune system, expending the energy and resources required for future health now, during the crises of the pleasure, no matter how sub-par, disgraceful, or illegal. It will leave you far more likely to live, or die, carelessly, for a rare opportunity at pleasure, when it manifests itself. The physical demands of emergency preparedness will wear you down in every way. <br />-27 On posture: To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. It means adopting the burden of self-concious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and morality are only dimly comprehended. It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality. <br />-28 On why posture is important: Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for it's calming influence. People, including yourself, will start to assume that you are competent and able (or at least they will not immediately conclude the reverse). Emboldened by the positive responses you are now receiving, you will begin to be less anxious. You will then find it easier to pay attention to the subtle social clues that people exchange when they are communicating. You conversations will flow better, with fewer awkward pauses. This will make you more likely to meet people, interact with them, and impress them. Doing so will not only genuinely increase the probability that good things will happen to you--it will also make those good things feel better when they do happen. <br />-43 On duality and balance: To straddle that fundamental duality is to be balanced: to have one foot firmly planted in order and security, and the other in chaos, possibility, growth and adventure. When life suddenly reveals itself as intense, gripping and meaningful; when time passes and you're so engrossed in what you're doing you don't notice--it is there and then that you are located precisely on the border between order and chaos. The subjective meaning that we encounter there is the reaction of our deepest being, our neurologically and evolutionarily grounded instinctive self, indicating that we are ensuring the stability but also the expansion of habitable, productive territory, of space that is personal, social and natural. It's the right place to be, in every sense. You are there when--and where--it matters. That's what music is telling you, too, when you're listening--even more, perhaps, when you're dancing--when its harmonious layered patterns of predictability and unpredictability make meaning itself well up from the most profound depths of your Being. <br />-48 On Adam and Eve: Being human, and wanting to know more, Eve decides to eat the fruit. Poof! She wakes up: she's conscious, or perhaps self-conscious, for the first time. Now, no clear-seeing, conscious woman is going to tolerate an unawakened man. So, Eve immediately shares the fruit with Adam. That makes him self-conscious. Little has changed. Women have been making men self-conscious since the beginning of time. They do this primarily by rejecting them--but they also do it by shaming them, if men do not take responsibility. Since women bear the primary burden of reproduction, it's not wonder. It is very hard to see how it could be otherwise. But the capacity of women to shame men and render them self-conscious is still a primal force of nature.<br />-53 On human stupidity: Why would someone buy prescription medication for his dog, and then so carefully administer it, when he would not do the same for himself? Now you have the answer, derived from one of the foundational texts of mankind. Why should anyone take care of anything as naked, ugly, ashamed, frightened, worthless, cowardly, resentful, defensive, and accusatory as a descendant of Adam? Even if that thing, that being, is himself? And I do not mean at all to exclude women with this phrasing. <br />-54 On evil: Only man will inflict suffering for the sake of suffering.<br />-59 On self-sacrifice: To sacrifice ourselves to God (to the highest good, if you like) does not mean to suffer silently and willingly when some person or organization demands more from us, consistently, than is offered in return. That means we are supporting tyranny, and allowing ourselves to be treated like slaves. It is not virtuous to be victimized by a bully, even if that bully is oneself. <br />-62 On self-responsibility: To treat yourself as if you were someone you are responsible for helping is, instead, to consider what would be truly good for you. This is not "what you want." It is also not "what would make you happy." Every time you give a child something sweet, you make that child happy. That does not mean that you should do nothing for children except feed them candy. "Happy" is by no means synonymous with "good." You must get children to brush their teeth. They must put on their snowsuits when they go outside in the cold, even though they might object strenuously. You must help a child become a virtuous, responsible, awake being, capable of full reciprocity--able to take care of himself and others, and to thrive while doing so. Why would you think it acceptable to do anything less for yourself? <br />-63 On vision and direction: Don't underestimate the power of vision and direction. These are irresistible forces, able to transform what might appear to be unconquerable obstacles into traversable pathways and expanding opportunities. Strengthen the individual. Start with yourself. Take care with yourself. Define who you are. Refine your personality. Choose your destination and articulate your Being. <br />-64 On rule two: You could begin by treating yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping. <br />-80 On fallen people: It is far more likely that a given individual has just decided to reject the path upward, because of its difficulty. perhaps that should even be your default assumption, when faced with such a situation. That's too harsh, you think. you might be right. Maybe that's a step too far. But consider this: failure is easy to understand. No explanation for its existence is required. In the same manner, fear, hatred, addiction, promiscuity, betrayal, and deception require no explanation. It's not the existence of vice, or the indulgence in it, that require explanation. Vice is easy. Failure is easy, too. It's easier not to shoulder a burden. It's easier not to think, and not to do, and not to care. It's easier to put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today, and drown the upcoming months and years in today's cheap pleasures. <br />-82 On unhealthy relationships: Maybe instead of continuing our friendship I should just go off somewhere, get my act together, and lead by example.<br />-82 On rule 3: If you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness. They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not. This will help bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner. People who are not aiming up will do the opposite. They will off er former smoker a cigarette and a former alcoholic a beer. They will become jealous when you succeed, or do something pristine. They will withdraw their presence or support, or actively punish you for it. They will over-ride your accomplishment with a past action, real or imaginary, of their own. Maybe they are trying to test you, to see if your resolve is real, to see if you are genuine. But mostly they are dragging you down because your new improvements cast faults in an even dimmer light. <br />When you dare aspire upward, you reveal the inadequacy of the present and the promise of the future. Then you disturb others, in the depths of their souls, where they understand that their cynicism and immobility are unjustifiable. You play Abel to their Cain. You remind them that they ceased caring not because of life's horrors, which are undeniable (Fairview, Alberta), but because they do not want to life the world up on their shoulders, where it belongs. <br />Don't think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy people than with bad unhealthy people. It's not. A good, healthy person is an ideal. It required strength and daring to stand up near such a person. Have some humility. Have some courage. Use your judgement, and protect yourself from too-uncritical compassion and pity. Make friends with people who want the best for you. <br />-88 On success and failure: Imagine that you are very good at some, middling at others, and terrible at the remainder. Perhaps that how it should be. You might object: I should be winning at everything! But winning at everything might only mean that you're not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you're now growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning. Should victory in the present always take precedence over trajectory across time? <br />-91 On resentment: But resentment always means one of two things. Either the resentful person is immature, in which case he or she should shut up, quit whining, and get on with it, or there is tyranny afoot--in which case the person subjugated has a moral obligation to speak up. Why? Because the consequence of remaining silent is worse. Of course, it's easier in the moment to stay silent and avoid conflict. But in the long term, that's deadly. When you have something to say, silence is a lie--and tyranny feeds on lies. When should you push back against oppression, despite the danger? When you start nursing secret fantasies of revenge; when your life is being poisoned and your imagination fills with the wish to devour and destroy. <br />-93 On past, present, and future: The past is fixed, but the future--it could be better. It could be better, some precise amount--the amount that can be achieved, perhaps, in a day, with some minimal engagement. The present is eternally flawed. But where you start might not be as important as the direction you are heading. Perhaps happiness is always to be found in the journey uphill, and not in the fleeting sense of satisfaction awaiting at the next peak. Much of happiness is hope, no matter how deep the underworld in which that hope was conceived. <br />-95 On improvement: You might ask yourself, "What could I say to someone else--my friend, my brother, my boss, my assistant--that would set things a bit more right between us tomorrow? What bit of chaos might I eradicate at home, on my desk, in my kitchen, tonight, so that the stage could be set for a better play? What snakes might I banish from my closet--and my mind?" Five hundred small decisions, five hundred tiny actions, compose your day, today, and every day. Could you aim one or two of these at a better result? Better, in your own private opinion, by your own individual standards? Could you compare your specific personal tomorrow with your specific personal yesterday? Could you use your own judgment, and ask yourself what that better tomorrow might be? <br />Aim small. You don't want to shoulder too much to begin with, given your limited talents, tendency to deceive, burden of resentment, and ability to shirk responsibility. Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be be a tiny bit better than they were this morning. Then you ask yourself, "What could I do, that I would do, that would accomplish that, and what small thing would I like as a reward?" Then you do what you have decided to do, even if you do it badly. Then you give yourself that damn coffee, in triumph. Maybe you feel a bit stupid about it, but you do it anyway. And you do the same thing tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. And, with each day, your baseline of comparison gets a little higher, and that's magic. That's compound interest. Do that for three years, and your life will be entirely different. Now you're aiming for something higher. Now you're wishing on a star. Now the beam is disappearing from your eye, and you're learning to see. And what you aim at determines what you see. That's worth repeating. What you aim at determines what you see. <br />-108 On three questions: "What is it that is bothering me?" "Is it something I could fix?" and "Would I actually be willing to fix it?" If you find that the answer is "no," to any or all of the questions, then look elsewhere. Aim lower. <br />-110 On realizations: Realization is dawning. Instead of playing the tyrant, therefore, you are paying attention. You are telling the truth, instead of manipulating the world. You are negotiating, instead of playing the martyr or the tyrant. You no longer have to be envious, because you no longer know that someone else truly has it better. You no longer have to be frustrated, because you have learned to aim low, and to be patient. You are discovering who you are, and what you want, and what you are willing to do. You are finding that the solutions to your particular problems have to be tailored to you, personally and precisely. You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself. <br />-122 On neglected children: Children can be damaged as much or more by a lack of incisive attention as they are by abuse, mental or physical. This is damage by omission, rather than commission, but it is no less severe and long-lasting. Children are damaged when their "mercifully" inattentive parents fail to make them sharp and observant. and awake and leave them, instead, in an unconscious and undifferentiated state. Children are damaged when those charged with their care, afraid of any conflict or upset, no longer dare to correct them, and leave them without guidance. I can recognize such children on the street. They are doughy and unfocused and vague. They are leaden and dull instead of golden and bright. They are uncarved blocks, trapped in a perpetual state of waiting-to-be. <br />Such children are chronically ignored by their peers. This is because they are not fun to play with. Adults tend to manifest the same attitude (although they will deny it desperately when pressed). When I worked in daycare centres, early in my career, the comparatively neglected children would come to me desperately, in their fumbling, half-formed manner, with no sense of proper distance and no attentive playfulness. They would flop, nearby--or directly on my lap, no matter what I was doing--driven inexorably by the powerful desire for adult attention, the necessary catalyst for further development. It was very difficult not to react with annoyance, even disgust, to such children and their too-prolonged infantilism--difficult not to literally push them aside--even thought I felt very badly for them, and understood their predicament well. I believe that response, harsh and terrible thought it may be, was an almost universally-experienced internal warning signal indicating the comparative danger of establishing a relationship with a poorly socialized child: the likelihood of immediate and inappropriate dependence (which should have been the responsibility of the parent) and the tremendous demand of time and resources that accepting such dependence would necessitate. Confronted with such a situation, potentially friendly peers and interested adults are much more likely to turn their attention to interacting with other children who cost/benefit ratio, to speak bluntly, would be much lower. <br />-130 On teaching methods:<br />-137 On rules for a child:<br />-137 On discipline for a child:<br />-142 On five principles for discipline:<br />-144 On rule five:<br />-154 On abuse and human goodness:5<br />-158 On rule 6:<br />-164 On sacrifice and work: <br />-169 On sharing mammoth:<br />-172 On knowledge in their soul:<br />-174 On why we work:<br />-177 On the vicious cycle of true evil: <br />-178 On Carl's Yung quote: <br />-183 On divine intervention: <br />-186 On Christianity's success: <br />-187 On humanity's failure with Christianity: <br />-192 On disciplinary structures and free mind: <br />-193 On god's death and Jung's discovery: <br />-194 On thinking, facts, and ideas: <br />-196 On evil, the cornerstone belief: <br />-198 On meaning, the seventh rule: <br />-205 On being fake:<br />-209 On manipulating the world: <br />-211 On hiding the potentialities of the unrealized self: <br />-214 On speaking up:<br />-215 On Great Thinkers and Untruths<br />-221 On Deceit: <br />-230 On Truth and Rule 8:<br />-239 On Memory:<br />-241 On Thinking: <br />-246 On Roger's Rule:<br />-246-248 On the advantages of RR:<br />-251 On speaking to individuals:<br />-253 On witty conversations: <br />-254-255 On having true conversations and rule 9:<br />-282 On Rule 10 dragon: <br />-287 On living on the edge:<br />-297 On boys and girls:<br />-299 On career and marriage:<br />-303 On hierarchies:<br />-303 On the timescale of cultural evolution:<br />-304 On assumptions and truism:<br />-306 On Marxism: <br />-326 On eternal dominance battles and men: <br />-328 On men's code of behavior when working:<br />-331 On rule 11 boys to men: <br />-352 On rule 12 cats, a form of being:<br />-363 On the young man:<br />-366 On opportunities for granted:</p>
