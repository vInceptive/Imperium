	First entry of 2019. I spent December 30th dopamine fasting and chilled on new years eve. I kind of did nothing yesterday but I'm still on my routine. I had a lot of realizations on this fast and ideas about myself particularly. I have all the knowledge now I need to implement them. I feel that 2019 is going to be a good year. 2018 has been extremely life changing. Improve everyday. Currently I am going to resume 12 rules and I'm taking an online course on the science of exercise. I want to go to LindyGroove tomorrow and I've studied up on IP's BeeFriend course. Fasting was good in realizing my demon and internal struggles. It's been cold these days but I've endured.

	I've been learning about the science behind exercise this week/today. It has been a good in-depth look at how muscles and energy work, literally. ATP is the reason why our muscles move and is the basis for physical work. A fundamental reaction can build and stack upon itself and eventually even get a man to space, wow. Not much else happening, yesterday we finally beat borderlands 2, op8 and all the raid bosses. I've been feeling kind of demotivated lately and binging zero sum rewards. I think going to LindyGroove tonight will get me out of it. Positive sum rewards right? The cold and the lack of progress is weighing on me. One of the downsides to vacations. Let's read more and watch less. That will be my motto. I'm also going to be more engaging with people to build acquaintances and perhaps friendships. Pretty much do the opposite of last friday. ED: Dad turned off power today to install a new thermostat. I was angry at first but meditated instead to relieve the emotions. Let's get it.

	It's a friday and I'm feeling good. I went with Derek to my first LindyGroove. I think it went really well. I wasn't really nervous and got the basics down. I'm pretty awkward still but I can easily get it down with practice. Last night we did not have the heat on. It was a bit of suffering. Apparently I've gotten comfortable with the heat on every night. A good wake up call I think. Tomorrow me and the FT boys are going to get Sushi Me, a new ayce place in Alhambra. It's going to be good. Somewhat late start today but I'll manage. Too much Twitch.

	Today I went to Sushi Me. It was delicious but really similar to all the other ayce spots in the area. The belly was good and the service was good. We then went to Almansor park and walked around. It started raining while we were walking to Vincent Lugo Park. From the outside the park was pretty plain but inside was pretty cool. There's a certain charm to walking through a beautiful without other people around. I got soaked and drove home. When I got home I discord with Derek and Chris about relationships. I'm the last person to ask for advice but it was insightful. Today was a good day but my mentality was pretty out of it right now. ED: Mood has been depressed. Solution: ?

Jake was with Ao yesterday and it was cool. They ate at an american breakfast cafe and made bonsais. Jake said something along the lines of "somethings need to be destroyed before they can grow again" I believe this is true for humans too. The superego needs to take over and implode before the mind can be whole. I'm still learning about the psyche but I think that mental duress can help open the mind. That's why we need to try something that scares us. Only then can the mind collapse and rebuild, stronger.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	I woke up pretty early today and worked out. I went to my modern dance class at around noon. It was a bit strange and my first impressions are often really bad reads. Three girls really stood out to me. The class itself was weird to me mostly because of how foreign it was. I've never danced without shoes and socks. I think this might be good for me to get out of my comfort zone and become used to acting weird to a point that it becomes normal. It's all expression after all and there's no wrong way to do that. I was actually expecting the class to be more like jazz or hip hop dancing or like club dancing but it's a lot more like free form dancing with yoga and ballet. There's a lot of stretching and flexibility, range of motion. I'll keep at it since I've committed.

	Gw2 patch day for All or Nothing. It's the first patch of 2019 and I'm quite excited about it. I've been playing this game for almost five years now and it has been an experience. It has been an escape from all the ups and downs of life and place of comfort. I could go on for days about gw2 but for now lets return to real life. Yesterday was pretty good. I managed to read for more than an hour and watched rift rival practice streams. I got to stop spending so much time on twitch. It's hypocritical of me for criticizing the world for being brainless screen zombies when I myself am one too. Set your own house in perfect order before you criticize the world.

It's getting a little less weird but I'm not 100% comfortable yet. I had a nice interaction with Amanda today. I need to practice my ballet terms and techniques. Also yesterday I watched the Raj Patel king of the hill with big streamers. Sodapopin won between xQC and Greekgodx. Yeah I don't feel like typing more.

	The new beasts units are coming out for FeH. I'm not too excited for them even though I was originally disappointed the game didn't have them on release. Besides that I finished the latest episode of Gw2 All or Nothing. It was nothing. Aurene dead. F. In modern dance we had a substitute who taught us some similar stuff. It was alright. A bit of freestyle 8 count was the most memorable thing during this session. A few people were missing I think because of the substitute. Today is lindygroove but I'm having doubts. It's a fun experience but I don't seem to be practising or experiencing much. The $8 for less than an hour of lessons really grinds my gears. Social dance next semester should be cool. I'm going to find a better source of income. Right now I'm saving for the dog but my financial independence isn't there yet.

	<h1 id="10">Jury Duty</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Yesterday I had jury duty. It wasn't bad. My first time at the Pasadena court house. I signed in, went through the basics, read a bit, then went on a two hour lunch break. I walked to Ramen Tatsunoya and had a very rich broth ramen for $19. I chilled at the park on the way back and went back to jury duty. The case itself was really interesting. Something about Carrie Fisher's holdings being disputed by a mother of a heroin user? Apparently it was a pretty big case since there were 113 of us just on Friday and 30ish already coming back Tuesday. I really wanted to find out more about the case since the best lawyers in America were on this case. It also dealt with medicine, drugs, entertainment industry, and some law. But selecting 12ish jurors in a pool of 60-70 people yeah right. I also had dance classes to attend so it was a good way to excuse myself. I'm curious about the case but happy to not do it. After that I walked across the street and read at the Pasadena library. It seemed historic and proper but I was tired. This Saturday morning I woke up late and worked out since I missed it yesterday. It seems that my Twitch habits haven't improved, I spend so much time watching vods or streams. Habit is a bitch. One last note I would like to add is that the experience yesterday showed me that people come from all walks of life and each person is experienced in their own way. To have predispositions and prejudices about anything on an individual is a fault that everyone makes. Even the judge must serve as jury.

Basically streamers playing against each other in a Riot hosted tournament. I've been watching a lot of scrims so I'm excited for that. Also Game of Thrones teaser was revealed yesterday.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Today was okay. I biked in the cold wet day. It got sunny before noon then rained again around 2pm. Modern dance has been painful. My memorizing of routines and execute is extremely lacking. I'm also having a hard time with flexibility and arm movement. Those are areas I need to improve on. Also I would like to make friends with some classmates. Having understanding of how friendships work and executing it is actually strangely difficult. In other news I finished Power of Habit and began transcribing some research to the site. I seem to be recovering and being more productive. Twitch and Gw2 still seem to be a huge habitual time sink though. I'll need to apply my research to getting rid of these habits. Blue Diamond wasabi and soy sauce seems to be my reward doggy treat. ED: Really awkward silence when talking with people on discord. Solution: It's all in my head, I don't actually know what they feel and that makes me uncomfortable which feeds to my negative feedback loop. Just say what's on your mind, it seems to work in the past. HEFE (HobbiesEntertainmentFoodEnvironment)

	Last day of rain for this week, hooray. Didn't bike today since it was raining pretty hard. I decided to make it up through dancing as best as I could. Most of the dance class went well I tried to implement some of the tips I picked up from some small amount of thought vampiring yesterday. I realize two things about my dance, my choreography memorization is terrible and I lack a lot of arm movement. Oh and my head position is always looking at the mirror or instructor so it's a bit awkward. Anyways near the end of class we did an improv dance where anyone can join and leave the floor and use all that we learned. I went in about three times and went ham; it was really fun. I enjoyed it more than I thought. I do enjoy the freedom and movement of improv.

Going to wash my car finally. I've bought supplies and tools to help. Full detail cleaning in awhile. Not much else to say. I ate catfish dinner at grandmas last night and talked a with Derek about the going ons and what not. This weekend I'm going to get good at ballet and routine memorizations.

	Not much happened. I had dinner with parents and sister last night at Kim Tar. It was alright. We never really ate dinner as a family much growing up so these dinners are a little weird. If I ever get children remind me to actually have family dinners and actually be interested in their lives. This morning I went on a bike ride. It was super nice since I hadn't biked in the sun in almost two weeks. Besides that I've finished the power of habit and I'm getting stuff done. I've gotta over that weird slight depression at the start of this year. Things are going more in the way I envision now.

	I completely finished the site for habit and got a neck routine in order yesterday. I realized that my chair might not be the best in terms of ergonomics. I found a site that sells quality chairs for about $300 so I'll get that soon. I also realized that my twitch routine is actually a reward that has gone haywire. The intended goal was to use twitch as a dopamine reward to feel good but the problem is that the reward itself does not end until the streamer stops streaming. So I have to limit and self-discipline myself when it comes to spending time on twitch. I've implemented an hourly timer with my neck routine so that this can occur.

	Death is a song by White Lies that I was listening to on the way home from dance today. Dance was good. I learned that its important to focus on getting automation in your movements rather than spotting the instructor. Tomorrow is our midterm so I'll need to remember that. According to the rubric there are five things to focus on: form, coordination, musicality, dynamics, appetite. We did a partner warm up with lots of contact in today's class. That was fun and humanizing. I just check canvas and bought tickets for a dance performance for my paper. That should be interesting. Shiphtur's team lost in twitch rivals so I'm done with that. Let's focus up.

Rule 8 emphasizes the truth and this is true for nice guys too. I'm starting to notice patterns in my research that makes me wonder if the universe is interconnected somehow in the metaphysical realm. None of these ideas and thoughts are physical yet they have some connection. I was a bit out of it today. I think I was still digesting breakfast. All good. Tomorrow will be fun.

	Today was pretty awesome. Dance really good. We did a physical contact exercise and it was very human. Human contact is such an important thing that seems to be missing in today's society. We then split into groups and had to create a dance routine using whatever we did in class. We ended up with a decent performance using the theme of an octopus. It was really fun and I think I could've helped choreographed more but I had a decent amount of input. Beside that I just chilled all day. I'm still on a social high so life is sunny. I'm going to get back at it so smile.

	Decent workout this morning. Read some Tools of Titans in between sets. Got some good insight on how people need to be more selfish in a sense that they put themselves before others. I think most of the improvement literature I've been reading has emphasized this. Stop caring about others and care about what you want. ToT is a very good book but my memory is so very limited I can't seem to retain all this knowledge and reference them when I need. I'm hoping to make my sheet more accessible so that I reference these ideas more readily. I think that will be my goal for this year. Organize and functionalize knowledge into my sheet/sites. Another thing I is the Dickens Process where one examine limiting beliefs in the past, present, and future. A lot like the dopamine fast writing but in a group setting. LCS and Dustin's birthday in Tokyo is this weekend, that will be fun. "Happiness is my natural state."

Overall I didn't really understand it since it was super abstract. It was cool seeing what we learned in class being practiced in a professional setting. This morning I went on a 15 mile ride and then watched 9 hours of Dustin's birthday bus stream in less than 3 hours. I had a mild headache after and did some errands. Bought Dad who is currently sick with a cough some Pho. LCS is currently on so I'll be watching this. Face fear and tell only truth.

Looking at boulder university's site I found a Google IT certificate program that I will do. With this and an AS from PCC I should be able to get a career in IT around 2020. So now I have a plan to focus on for the next two years. Spend two years to figure out what you want to do the rest of your life.

I think if I stayed behind to stretch or practice a bit more, I would improve greatly. In terms of weather it has been nice. Nothing more to say. I'm going to try hard more.

I also slept a little later because I was drawing my anime avatar. During my workout I got pretty pumped and went to dance. I tried hard during dance but a lot of people seemed tired so the energy kind of died but I did everything at maybe 80% so that I didn't hurt myself, which I still split my big toe skin... On the way to and back from school I listened to Weird Al's Albuquerque song which lifted my mood because of how absurd and hilarious it was. Yeah life isn't too bad. Duma god in FeH now. I managed to clear the LHB without too much trouble. When you're down, listen to Albuquerque.

Last night it took me awhile to fall asleep. The Si Demon was raging about the past. I basically reviewed my past 6-7 years since before going to UCI and everything major that occurred after that. It was an emotional fiesta. I think the thought that started that rollercoaster was thinking about my parents' poor parenting. That led to thoughts about neglect and summers before college.

He met a girl named Mako in Shinjuku, they got coffee and went to Taito game center to play crane games. The event itself wasn't exciting but the interactions and conversation was meaningful. I think that is what is missing in life today. We seek meaning in doing exciting and "content" things while what truly matters is right in front of us. I gave advice to Andrew and Steven about exercise but I don't think they'll follow it. "A strong man cannot help a weaker unless that weaker is willing to be helped, and even then the weak man must become strong of himself; he must, by his own efforts, develop the strength which he admires in another. None but himself can alter his condition."

Something about Leffen losing to a MKLeo triggered me and I felt very lonely and sad. Then I binged porn. Worst decision yesterday. I slowly tried to recover. Tried to play golf with the boys but it wouldn't work. Then I missed my bedtime and stayed up. Nothing good ever happens past midnight. Then I binged until 4 am when I orgasmed. Not my best mental. On the brightside, today hasn't been bad. I reset. Hope my hormonal balance resets before tomorrow.

We went back into groups and unfortunately there were less people this time. It was fun though, I got to practice my camille twists more. As I was driving home the weather was cloudy and suddenly the clouds tore apart and sunlight streamed through for a couple of minutes. That was when I realized I had to enjoy the moment, let go of your worries.

	Decent day today. I cycled in the rain a bit, that was cold and fun /s. Jake went to a Mongolian restaurant in Okubo that was really awesome with Amy and Jenny. Mongolian food looks so delicious, very rich and decadent. In dance we are choreographing our own performance, it's getting interesting but a lot of people are becoming absent. Yesterday we celebrated chinese new years at grandmas. It was good but too much fried foods and too short. I'm going to start a handstand routine soon but I got to improve my rotators. Read about rule 11.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline"> 
	The handstand routine yesterday fucked up my eye blood vessels. I looked like a sith. Good workout this morning. It was very cold in my room. Showered and went to dance. I fucked up my left knee sliding during the warmups. We spent the majority of time working on the performance. It's getting better. We covered a lot after the twirls. A lot of time was also spent on the sliding part so both my knees hurt. I will use my hips more during slides. After that my line decided to do a back roll. I had reservations about it but managed to get it without breaking my neck. Today during my workout I read Tools of Titans and there was a section about fear. I remember one quote that really stood out to me: "Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage." I think by trying everything your life will have more meaning, or at least more experience. The worst you can get is a broken neck. But human bodies are strong if not resilient, we recover better than before.

	I didn't feel as sore as I thought I would be this morning. Went out in 40F temperatures to cycle. The sun was out in force so it was a song of fire and ice. I got pretty excited for dance today. The weather was nice and I got a lot of sun. I talked with Jiho once I got there and went through warmups, a group improv warmup, across the floor, and then practiced the final. When we split into the group I kind of just chilled. I was I little annoyed and afraid to contribute since everyone was so outspoke. Maybe my voice is too low in pitch and volume. I seem to always have a hard time getting my message across. Taking speech will help with that I hope. Went home in a bitter mood because I knew I could've contributed more. Use your failure as motivation. I made a steak with spinach and it was good. Just imagine having a conversation with everyone, one-on-one. Don't forget to smile.

	<h1 id="37">Chair</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	I binged hard yesterday. I know the reasoning behind it. The weird class and overindulging of food yesterday left me in a sleepy and semi depressed mood. Then I started shopping for a chair because I kept thinking about posture. I went in and out of buying chairs which degraded my willpower until I had very little left. I managed to pull through and ignore my buyers remorse. Around 11pm when I finished my work I had little willpower left. There I should have called it and went to bed but I opened up Rush's stream and watched then started binging. Five hours later I went to bed disappointed and tired. I picked the pieces off the ground today. I figured I might as well buy the chair as an investment for my future posture.

	It's saturday. I went on a cold 11 am ride. Feeling a bit better. I missed a few habits yesterday because I spent a lot of time on my modern dance paper. Overall I was feeling a bit gloomy and inept. Around 1 am Derek N wanted to play Tabletop. No one else wanted to play so I suggested just chatting. We talked for an hour and my mood improved. It's nice to have conversations that are balanced and there isn't any expectations just ponderings about life and not particular destination of topic. Anyways I'm going out to get shabu shabu with Jeff for lunch. To get the soba or not, that is the question.

	It's sunday afternoon. The weather has been rainy on and off. I went ahead and bought the Alera Elusion high back chair and a headrest attachment. Yesterday I had lunch with Jeff at oseyo shabu shabu in pasadena. It was okay. My first time having sukiyaki. It's a sweet broth which I don't really like. The shoyu sauce was kind of sour too which I wasn't a fan of. The beef rib eye wasn't that impressive and the soba was outclassed by Duck's. So overall I'd give it 3/5 stars. I finished and turned in my modern dance paper and now I'm just chilling. In gw2 I wanted to start the Aurora legendary collection but jesus there's so much collecting to do. I might work on it over time. Something to do when I don't know what to do. Going to finish up rules and dance. Doing too much at once leaves me with unfinished projects. It's been weird relaxing these past few days. I think I'm more happy working on my projects.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Standard monday. I went to modern dance and we rehearsed and tried to add more to group A's routine. We spent a lot of time discussing the details and going over the minor points. My movement oriented personality was very aggravated. We simply repeated the core combo twice and that was it. It didn't feel like it was our best or the most interesting thing but it's fine for a class thing. If I were to choreograph my own thing it would be way different. Our group has too many conflicting ideas and aggressive tendencies as is. With that off my chest, I'm a bit sad certain people aren't showing up to class. Such is life, people come and go. I need to use time with more valuably because they might just disappear one day. As such I'll try my best with regards to this class, big change soon. Today was a taste of the chaos to come.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Yesterday I did my first fear setting. It helped me realize that most of my fears are irrational and came up with the three rule system. I tried to implement it but I was still held back by habit and memory fear. I started the richest man in Babylon and trying to finish end of leash. Two more days in dance. Not enough time Pepehands. Today the director of Kung Fu Hustle announced a sequel, don't know if that is true but it's a damn good movie. I loved it as a kid. Might be in my top 5. Get out of your head sir.

	The mars rover Opportunity was finally confirmed lost today. Last June a dust storm had covered the rover in a fatal layer of dust. Opportunity landed on Mars on January 25, 2004. Facebook and Youtube wasn't a thing. George W. Bush was still in his first presidency. Originally the pair of rovers were designed for 90-day lifetimes. Spirit was lost in 2010. That news left me feeling sad this morning. In modern dance we cleaned up the final and practiced. I assembled my chair when I got home. I hope this chair can help correct my poor posture, nerd neck, and rounded shoulders.

	I'm not sitting on the chair right now. Standing and typing is so awkward. Today is valentines day. Couple minutes before I go to modern dance. We have our final today. It's been raining since yesterday. Pretty somber mood around. I've been marking the dance since the morning and reading some Words of Radiance. My chair is being jerry rigged by dad because the headrest is too far forward. Last day, this is going to go well. The learning how to learn course I started is going well. I'm learning a lot about neuroscience, would highly recommend.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Yesterday was the last modern dance class. I tried my best but probably performed about 70% of what I could do. I didn't really connect with anyone there except the boys but it wasn't meaningful interactions. I left with a bitter mood yesterday. On the way out there was a red haired girl holding the door open while reading. She was so good looking, I should've complemented her. This is regret. Fear and doubt. The riskiest decision is indecision. Today I cut my hair really short. I followed the salonguy's undercut tutorial and it went well. Undercut with a connected fade. Feeling good after my workout and food. Tomorrow we're going to Sturtevant Falls for a morning hike. No fear.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Came back from the day. It was pretty good until the buffet. The day started with a hike to Sturtevant Falls. The week before has been rainy so the river was flow plentifully. My foot got soaked thoroughly. After the falls we went back to the creek trail to add an extra five miles. Along the way we had to cross the river multiple times. The river is like any obstacle in life. At first it is really difficult and daunting. We almost gave up in the very beginning. After the next four or five crossings we pretty much accepted the fact that we were soaked and kept going. The second hike was more meaningful than the first hike to SF and I think we bonded a lot more. I also got to interact with passerbyers more meaningfully too. All in all a tiringly wet but good hike. After that we went to Shiki buffet on Rosemead and I ate more than I should've. Remember to never get a bunch of ice cream after a buffet. That and something in my contacts left me in a drained and stressed state. I went home and showered then drove my parents to Hilton for their reunion thing. Went I got back, home alone I decided to pmo and here we are. Not the best ending to a rather glorious day but we drop regret and move on.

	Made some baked spaghetti yesterday and it fucked up my stomach. I think it was the cheese. Yesterday was a good reset day. Managed to do everything and more. I'm feeling pretty good, today is the first class of spring. It's been pretty cold. Currently watching Averse play battlerite. Playing a bit of gw2. They announced the first wvw mount today. I've been doing the Convergence: Requiem armor collection. The learning how to learn course has been good. It's not structured as well as the exercise one but it is more entertaining. Nearly done with Leash and Bablyon. I want to also review 12 Rules via site after Learning review.

	Yesterday was my first speech class. The teacher was really cool. She was very blunt yet caring. I could sense the wisdom of age from her and I think I'll learn a lot and grow from this class. We did a speech as our first exercise to share our favorite vacation and it went well. I was a bit awkward at first but got comfortable practicing fear setting and the three rules. Getting home in the traffic though was terrible. I am feeling hopeful. Got first social dance class today. Time to be fearless.

	Social dance went okay. It was a bit awkward but familiar for me. I notice a lot of people were really focused and nervous because it was their first time. I know I could be more assertive and help them out but I didn't really and that kind of conflicted within me. Next class I'll make an effort to be more instructive. I was also a bit disappointed that no one retook the class from the last class except Crystal but that's okay. I think a few returned from another class so that's cool too. I got speech in three hours so I got to think of a cultural artifact.

	<h1 id="51">Inspiration</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	I got really inspired these past few hours. Yesterday during speech we had to make small talk with our fellow students and I chatted with two classmates, a pretty columbian girl and a stocky asian boy. I suck so much with names. I need to make a game and emphasize remembering names. Names are important to people. Anyways we had somewhat meaningful conversation and shared hefes. It left me confident and hopeful. Inspired me to talk with people more. Second source of inspiration was a twitch streamer named Lara who can learn a piece of music and replay it instantly on her piano. That amount of talent and hardwork just blew my mind. She can play a ridiculous amounts of memorized songs too. I was just listening and watching her vods with my mouth open. She did a 2 hour medley of songs in tiny pieces with incredible precision and ability. So many emotions and feels from the many pop culture songs in such a small amount of time. From her I was inspired to pick up the guitar again and learn how to play it. Finally this morning while working out I read some ToT and learn about the death countdown timer. With this I was inspired to predict the date I would die, basically the date of an average asian american living in California. That date was like April 1, 2080. So I was inspired to add this to my excel sheet and count and manage my time left on Earth accordingly. ToT is just filled with inspiration, one of the best purchases of my life.

	Afternoon of a Saturday. I did some learning site work yesterday. Overall quite productive. Got a bit tired near the end but stuck through. Played a game of golf with the boys but it was not really meaningful. Been reading more words of radiance. It's so good, maybe my favorite fantasy series so far. First jazz dance class today. Jeff seems likeable and knowledgeable. I'm surprised he drove all the way from the OC for this class. Makes any excuse people have insignificant. I'm going to get some jazz shoes.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Went to eat at OK cafe in atlantic square yesterday. It was okay. Naming yourself ok seems to put a limit on the service/quality you produce it seems. I started reading the Art of Seduction. So far the preface seems really intriguing. I realize that I should immediately consolidate my research right after reading it because of working memory. By noting it and returning to it I seem to give an illusion of competence, that I highlight the work and seemingly mastered it and memorized it by copying it but that is far from the case. So I should still jot down notes but reteach myself after the session is over. More work and focus overall but a better learning experience in the long term. Played a good bit of wvw yesterday on black mag. I bought some jazz shoes and no show socks. Got a new wallpaper on wallpaper engine with a sun in the blue sky saying, "You will die!" XuX. Oh yeah and wedding in one month from today.

	Did some Seduction research yesterday. I learned about the Siren and their attributes. Seduction is social interaction with power in mind. It was interesting reading about Cleopatra, Marilyn, and the other sirens from history. I think this format of recalling and reteaching is better in memorization and consolidation. I went pretty hard today working out. I managed a 6-7-8-7-6 format for my pullups. After that I had to go meet Andrew to pickup my dad's laptop and some thin mints. I get so much anxiety and self-concious outside. To be a seducer one needs not be so self-absorbed and focus on the target, ignoring others. WvW and balance patch tomorrow.

	<h1 id="55">Millennials</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	I read a CMV earlier today about how millennials are responsible for fix the problems on Earth with regards to environment, society, and economy. Such a task is seemingly impossible, I would not even know where to start. The post claims that we are starting to reach positions of power and influence where we can change contemporary problems. I think this is where all my research is leading me to. The meaning of my research is to improve the world first by improving my self. Everyday I am growing more aware and more wise. I admit I don't have all the answers, not even half of it but by persevering I can at least make this thought a bit closer to reality. I have accomplished much these past three or four months, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. Thought and purpose leads to change, circumstances of its very nature. Stand up straight with your shoulders back my friend. <br>
	<br>
	As I read more from the thread I see that previous generations had to deal with the problems of prior generations too. The OP seems to be looking for someone to blame. I think some millennials are entitled and haven't really experienced enough suffering. Suffering is a universal human experience. Complaining about it isn't going to solve the issue. Hell the worst large scale suffering my generation had to face was a recession and the iraq war, which was more or less a glorified retaliation to terrorism. We did not face a great depression, the rise of totalitarianism, or the horrors of the cold war and its communistic influences. We as a generation must not be naive. We have suffered yes and will continue to suffer. But we must not be hateful or condemnatory to other generations rather we must be gentle and forgiving. Only together can we learn from each other and preserve ourselves as a race.

Speech was pretty good yesterday, I'm getting a lot more comfortable in public speaking. I also felt a self-conscious about my hair all day yesterday. I know no one is going to care but I just bugged me. Irrational fear... I finished rule 2 yesterday, granted it is a shell of the actual lesson Peterson teaches. I left out the duality from taoism and story of adam and eve and a lot of the intro/evil out. I would like to review those concepts more when I have the time but right now, my focus is on the ideas that would benefit me immediately. So treat yourself like a child you want to grow up to be your ideal self and take care of yourself in a way that would be meaningful.

I also got really out of it near the end. To improve I need to focus more only on myself and my partner. Everyone else doesn't matter. I keep waking up later and later too. My average wake up time is like 930 now. Two hours from my target time. I need to make a hard limit for staying up late. In bed before midnight and no snoozing. Today while cycling something got into my right contact and I was blinded by the tears and sun. Like the sun physically hurt to look at. I felt blind and it did not help that I was riding down Rosemead blvd. Like going on the kessel run blind... Anyways those two events kind of ruined my mood. Need to reset and move on.

I think I need some form of exercise on Sunday mornings to get me going. I'll dance or practice handstands on Sunday mornings otherwise I'll feel bad for missing routine and it tends to spiral out of control. Also I need to focus mode better. I was distracted so much yesterday and half-assed my work. The problem spiralled out of control after I visited soapland on jake's discord. I couldn't concentrate all day for some reason. It's Monday and I'm back on the wagon. ED: I felt stressed and procrastinated to avoid the pain. Focus mode and finish it so you can relax. Procrastination = willpower drain.

	Yesterday was not a good day but it got better. When you are at your lowest there is nowhere to go but up. In speech we were proofreading our outlines. I genuinely tried to give advise and criticism. I think it went well. People seemed receptive. I was in awkward mode though. I went home and got seduced into watch the Rajjechelor featuring Hasan. I'll admit it is pretty fake but genuine at the same time. The girls on there were really good actors. I guess it's my guilty pleasure. Anyways that was the first time I saw Moon_straeuxx? How the hell do you pronounce that.. If I were to have a type I think she'd be it. WeirdChamp. Back on the grind today. I realized that I need to be more grateful. The reason why I get so burnt out and depressed is that I try too hard and never sit back and look at what I have. It's hard to be negative when you are grateful. Also I've been reading a ton of Words of Radiance these past few days. I'm really close to finishing it. Definitely my number one fiction series.

	I finished Words of Radiance. The conclusion was a bit fast or maybe I read it too fast but very good. Rip Sadeas, Szeth is reborn, and Jasnah returns. Crazy stuff. I spent the night getting Oathbringer ready, not sure if I should start it because it'll consume so much time but it's there. Dance yesterday was okay but I feel that theres not enough passion or maybe I miss the old gang. Speaking of which I saw Angie during the break between class. She was looking very good. I never really spoke with her one on one and she's pretty wellspoken. Her accent is quite infectious too. Apparently she's taking like four or five dance classes atm which is crazy to me. She's getting graceful. Also got slapped by Grace last night. I think I'm Radiant now. I have a dream about self-consciousness as a human vice and how trivial it seems in the grand scheme of the universe. It's time to come out of the existential cesspool of nihilism and become Radiant.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Super slow friday today. I tried to wake up at 7am and slept for two hours. Didn't start working out until 11am. It's 4pm now as I type so I procrastinated for a good three hours. Not too much going on. Speech yesterday was ok, the first people to go presented. I'm going on Tuesday so I'm going to practice for that. Fear setting and spaced repetition. I'm getting anxious again missing my routine or at least delaying it. I want to achieve a few things today. Read TAOS and hopefully finish phase one, practice my speech and review the tips from the book, do some stretches, and talk with friends. That's it. After showering today I looked out the window from the bathroom and the light was blinding. The sun is out today and it was very comforting, cozy, and somewhat nostalgic at the same time. It was a good light.

	Relapsed twice yesterday. Very unproductive and depressing day yesterday. At the very end of last night I went through the Fortify course to get some inspiration. The section on gamifying life by having bad guys, powerups, and secret hero identity really helped me. I started reading Oathbringer and I decided to become a Knight Radiant. The order that I felt I connected with the most was the Elsecallers. I stayed up until 2 am doing the training and decided paying for Fortify would be worth it. I'm going to make it. This morning I went to Jazz class with 5 hours of sleep and I wasn't terrible. Not the best, very meh. I got motivated from that class too. Dalinar's backstory is very interesting too. Game of Throne final season coming next month. I made eggs, salad, pita, and protein shake for lunch and it was good. I'm about to play some PoE with Jeff and Chau. Going to the movies with Derek tonight. Life before Death. Strength before Weakness. Journey before Destination.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	I quit PoE. I was getting too addicted with it and uninstalled. Yesterday I watched Alita Battle Angel of Death. The animation and visuals were outstanding but the movie was riddled with cliches and pepega dialogue. This isn't a problem until it leads to plot holes that destroy any meaning to the story. Overall I give it a 7/10. I think it is overrated. We also ate at Borneo Indo food in Alhambra. It was good except the portions were kind of small. We got boba after at Tea Maru, second time I went there since the grand opening. It was a little better but still pretty average. We actually wanted to go to Philip Wang's new cafe, Bufamofo?, but they ran out of ingredients since with was a grand opening. I had Pho Hai today with the parents. Had some Pho Bo Kobe. The meat was good, at least better than regular thai and the soup actually had good spice. Would go agane. Recovering today and going to knock out the dailies. Speech has got me anxious but I'm a Radiant now. Life before Death. Strength before Weakness. Journey before Destination.

	Things have been okay. I'm slowly finding a balance between procrastination and the two modes of thinking. Still a large part procrastinating but I think I've done a decent amount today. I got my first speech mapped out for tomorrow, just need a bit more practice and to view tomorrow as practice, not some doomsday event like I used to view presentations. That boy has died and gone. I'm a Radiant now. Speaking of which, Oathbringer is so good. I can't keep myself from reading. It's giving more backstory to the characters and progressing the plot at the same time in a way that is so engaging. I've been thinking a little about seduction and it is a useful skill to have and a different view of social power dynamics is important to understand but I feel deep down that it is not entirely the right thing to do. Maybe it is my personality and understanding of social illusions but seduction is a very powerful and complicated matter. It's extremely manipulative in the darkest sense yet reassuring if done properly. A lie for truth. A broken smile. Life before Death. Strength before Weakness. Journey before Destination.

	Tuesday afternoon. Trying to remain calm and less anxious. My speech is today and I've been reviewing it. Feeling the angst but I'm okay. If I can get over my fear it'll be daijoubou. Been watching Jake's stream for about 3 hours. He had dinenr with the Tokyo Creative girls. Spicy Mustard was the nickname Shizuke? got because she was wearing a mustard shirt. They were in Harajuku eating some mexican food and pancake dessert. Something they talked about was the t sound in the american accent. We like to exclude or change the t to d in words like "letter" "Santa Monica" "restaurant" etc. I'm feeling good in the traditional sense. Trying to keep a smile on my face to affect my mood. Spent some time doing fortify. My goal is three weeks without hitting a hurdle. Going to fear set a little bit and maybe fold clothes. Life before Death. Strength before Weakness.

I faltered near the end, it's the first one the next will be better for sure. The class itself wasn't that enthusiastic but I neither was I. Reciprocity is a two way street. I redownloaded Path of Exile, I'll play it only when I have break time. I stretched pretty hard yesterday. It felt good and I wasn't too sore this morning. Lately I've been going harder on my workout progressions and I can feel it. More protein and more rest. I want to Start Rule 5 on the site today and review the Jazz sequence we learned in class.

All that dancing and socializing really made my tired though. I slept until 11 am and started really late today. It's already almost 6 pm right now. I procrastinate so much. I spent the afternoon researching and buying a dress shirt from Macys and a pocket square for the suit. These squares are such a scam but I need one for the wedding next week.

	Yesterday I picked up my dress shirt and celebrated PI day with some pie and pizza. Delicious. I spent the night summarizing rule 5 and slept late reading and playing PoE. I tried to wake up earlier today and worked out. I Read a bit of ToT during rest and one guy gave good insight on the Lazy Manifesto. It addressed everyone being too busy and how that's a brag and complaint at the same time. It also went into how little work really matter in the grand scheme of time. If everyone had a wage for doing nothing would the world be a better place? After all work is suffering in the most good sense. I would argue against it as would many people but then I thought back 2000 years ago. Everyone was farming and growing food and trading. If you told them back then that they just needed to sit around and talk all day to be wealthy and get food they would not believe you. Times change. Ideas change. Maybe we aren't ready to believe that our work can be automated yet. Such is revolution and evolution. Interesting stuff. I spent the afternoon researching and buying a linen shirt and pants. I hope these are as good as people claim them to be. I've been looking to buy some linen clothes for the summer/socal weather for awhile now. FeelsGoodMan.

I listened to some speeches yesterday mainly two about shoes, I didn't know collecting shoes has been such a big thing recently. Jake hung out with Kim Dao in Azabujuban yesterday. Pretty chill and funny stream. I enjoy watching him catch up with old friends and just joke around. The chicken rice place they went to looked so delicious too. I noticed I've been sleeping almost 9 hours on average which is way too much lately. I need to adhere to the rule to restore some order in my sleep schedule. It's sprinkling a bit this wednesday afternoon which is random since the past few days have been quite warm. I'm excited for dance today.

	Dance was pretty good yesterday. I tried and wasn't terrible but I knew I could be better. Things were okay until this noon. I procrastinated after my routine and couldn't find a vip to do my speech on. That was when I relapsed. After I tried to recouple my losses and delved into influential people in the world; I looked into literally 12,000 years of human history in less than two hours. I learned a lot but didn't find anyone... I looked into human population growth and what caused the boom in the past century, the black death, mesoptamia, religions, cultures, so much. I was getting a little existential. I went to speech class in this mood and was pretty self-conscious most of the time. I decided I was going to be confident and dropped into some discussions and whatnot, one particular one was about creationism. The main point of that story was that I kept feeling these past days that I could be something more. I suppose my life has been that hasn't it? It could be something more... Life before Death.

	I want to talk about mindset. Recently I have been too focused on failures as a negative thing. I think about it over and over to a point where I despise my actions and wasted potential. I research how to change and live a more meaningful life yet the implementation is lacking. I spend too much time doing the expedient. This thought process itself is negative. To change my mindset I am going to see failure as a pathway to growth and improve. Pain is the teacher that no one can ignore. Failure can either destroy you or you can use it to learn what not to do or what doesn't help you. Another thing is emotional states. These are temporary and staying attached to an emotional state is not a good idea. When you feel good it sucks when it ends and shit hits the fan. When you feel bad your actions and circumstances reflect that. To experience it and let it pass, to feel and appreciate then let go. This is truly enlightened mindset.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Sunday night. Today is the first episode of the final season of game of thrones. It's pretty hype. I relapsed last night/this morning. I just didn't go to bed and something triggered me to binge. Most of yesterday went fine until I came back from lunch and binged videogames and twitch. Modded GTA is cool but I kept running into problems with crashes and camera issues. This stressed me out a bit that and I played a lot of V2 with Jeff. My willpower just sapped and I binged. Which leads me to this morning/afternoon. I relapsed again after the GTA problems persist. Maybe I should uninstall GTA V it seems to be giving me more problems/expedience that I want. Another distraction. My itch to mod and drive cars does not seem to be able to be fulfilled through videogames. Still watching gta v rp. I need to return to the way. Follow the rules. Do what is meaningful.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Tuesday. Decent day yesterday. I was quite "busy" doing a pomodoro checklist method. I read a chapter about King, Warrior, Magician, Lover (KWML) and it was a bit strange. Psychology studies have been confusing too. I don't really understand how to type others when I don't know them on a fundamental level. It's really difficult. Being socially inept doesn't help either. I started the Happiness course on coursera. At first I thought it was a joke but the profesor isn't terrible and the sources of information seems reliable, I'll give it a shot even though my belief is happiness is almost non-existent. Dance-wise I'm having trouble with my pirouettes, they are so hard to execute. Game of Thrones was amazing yesterday. All the characters reuniting was mindblowing. Hope Arya wins the thronepool.

	Wednesday. Knocked out a couple of things yesterday. Lateish start today. I complied all my DayOne entries into here and it was definitely a catharsis of emotions and memories. Today I'm going to read more KWML, it's a bit abstract and historic in nature. Referencing past kings and stories. I have yet to find the aha moments in the work and I'll admit it's a bit dull. Also getting into the Happiness course. I took a survey on my happiness and I'm apparently unhappy (14/35?) in that measurement. I want to take advantage of my fortify subscription so I'll spend a good amount of time training there. For dance I'm improving, I want to perfect the techniques today: pirouttes, piques, and flags. I listened to Maria Popova in TF's podcasts, she seems very much like an INTJ in terms of personality and mentally so I resonate with her ideas but yeah I can see why humanity outcasts us. I picked up some book recommendations from her and hope I can learn more about whatever helps. Oh yeah, dirty mike. Dirty Mike or Michael Rickenburg is the most notorious person on NoPixel RP. His criminal record is insane and apparently he's still locked up.

	Thursday. More GTA RP. Spent a good deal of time watching Tony outrun the cops on nopixel. I learned some more yoyo picture tricks. Apparently Notre Dame burned down a few days ago. In KWML I read about the Warrior and its role in masculinity. Mostly honed in on emotional detachment and to live for a cause/belief greater than the individual. In Happiness we've getting into the seven deadly happiness sins. I'm a fair bit into Oathbringer now, the Kholinar arc and it's getting really good. Kaladin finally reveals himself to the wall guards/Azure. My sister is home today and she bought me green milk tea boba from A+ Tea House on San Gabriel and Broadway. The boba is really good. Chewy, fresh, sweet, and soft. Pretty high tier. The drink itself is okay, I did get regular ice.

	I relapsed today around 2 am. Staying up late and got anxious, didn't feel tired so I started binging until 6 am when I passed out. Woke up around 10am by an alarm and kept going. Not my best idea. Stayed half awake half asleep until I got out of bed around 12 and browsed reddit until 1ish. Workout routine and ate. Here I am now around 6pm wondering where my dad went. I must adhere to the rules more. My routine these passt few days have been good but hard on my body and mind. The sweet lure of numbing pleasure was too much. Now my mind is bogged down and tired. Lack of sleep and orgasms will do that to you. I'm going to get through as much routine right now as I can and promise to follow my rules and sleep by midnight. This place is also a reference to Shadesmar which I stopped reading on last night. The heroes failed to take back Kholinar and that somewhat influenced my mood too. No point blaming now. I bought some clothes from Yuniwro today. 2 Tees and a chino short for summer. Sayonara.

	Monday afternoon. Yesterday was pretty meh. I stayed up playing Terraria with the boys and woke up to get dim sum with grandma and family. Came home and just splurged on videogames, twitch, hentai, and porn. Doesn't feel too good but there is a brightside. I spent a good deal of time watching Kiwo's GTA rp and she is so good at roleplaying. Her character Trish spent the day harassing Breadna, going on a rv camping trip, and so much hilarity ensued. I haven't laughed that hard since a long while. Then at night she played Mother who was being investigated/stalked by a darkweb man named Jacob. It was like watching a freaking drama/thriller in GTA, so amazing. Today is Game of Thones episode 2, going to get as much done before then.

	Game update for gw2 today. I'm sleeping really late lately. Gta rp keeping me up. Yesterday was crazy. Bogg planned a cop murder and it was so Pepega. In the end it actually worked and he got away without any problems. Today's update changed a lot of classes to make them more consistent with the specialization. Daredevils can swipe now instead of steal... It's basically a nerf + unblockable. They also released a War Eternal Supply Package in the gem store which I purchased. 3.5k gems worth of stuff for 2.4k gems. I dig it. I also watched episode two season 8 of Game of Thrones. Pretty much builds up until the battle at Winterfell. Winter has come.

	Wednesday afternoon. Finished morning routines. My sleep habits have been horrendous. I'm producing too much melatonin keeping me asleep for longer than I should. Staying up late does this since I keep the blinds closed. I ended up choosing to do my information speech on sleep so that should be interesting. In KWML I learned about the magician archetype. It seems I may been in the shadow magician where I withhold knowledge to feel superior or do not share/practice my knowledge gained which is detrimental to masculinity. Reading about these archetypes is interesting yet I feel like it's very abstract and difficult to practice pragmatically. Into week 2 of the Happiness course on coursera, very insightful information. Wowee because Vader who plays Eugene/Mike on NoPixel once robbed a dog and it put it's hands up and gave him cash.

	Back to back relapses. This is not my week. Friday 4:53 pm. Super late start. Slept late and got awoken by Edison trimming the tree in front. Procrastinated on reddit/DL, I uninstalled it already as it seems too much like a timesink and grind. Dredged through my workout and ate. Screwed around on reddit/twitch and just started my day. It's going to be a short one. So I covered flow in the Happiness course and it seems like I instinctively knew about it but never really though about it or really defined it. With this knowledge, everything seems to make a bit more sense in the world. Ok.

	Saturday 6:55 pm. Woke up early to go to jazz dance today. It went okay. Played gw2 and feh and twitch until now. I'm getting headaches more and more often now after long gaming/viewing sessions. I finished KWML and think it's a meaingful read. The masculine archetypes though in my opinion is overly explained makes sense in the grand scheme of psychology. I really resonated with the exercises/practices written at the end of the book. I'll have to copy those down for future reference. I notice a trend that I relapse every Sunday probably because I get unhappy that I'm wasting time and indulging rather than do meaningful work/flow. Gonna take some advil and study a life of happiness.

	Sunday 3:17 pm. Slept late again. I watched Koil and Kiwo roleplay into the night. It was okay and interesting but not very productive. Woke up and went to grandpa and grandma's anniversary celebration today. Dad's side of the family. We ate and talked. This family is very memey and sarcastic. The children at least are pretty funny but immature in socializing. I guess a lot of people are like this. Most of the time we were watching the houston vs golden state nba game. The Mercado couple who had the wedding last month was there surprisingly. They had a video of their wedding that they showed us. Fun times. Spent about three hours there. I left with a sense of regret for not making more deep conversation with the family. Now I'm home about to play some vermintide 2 with Jeff.

I spent a good minute reliving and remembering the locations from the games and books. What a marvellous series.

	1:29pm Tuesday. A better start today. Still later than I would like. I spent a couple of hours after going to the library to watch VODs of Tony and Tori's wedding on NoPixel. Pretty funny stuff. They Rains of Castamere and had a scuffed singalong. Game of Thrones was insane yesterday. S803 was the final battle at Winterfell versus the night king. This episode was so intense. So many people died and the scenes were shot so brilliantly. The flow of the story was good too. It was hot and cold to give the audience a sense of hope and despair. So magnificent. Arya at the end was so cathartic.

I'm not sure if it's true happiness or meaningful but I enjoy it. I think this is why people seem to do meaningless things like consume entertainment even if it's not productive. Gotta get going.

Things are getting intense. Yesterday social went better than before. I actually had some fun messing around rather than worry about doing it right. I the girl with heels, she's seems happy.

	3:10pm Saturday. Blunder yesterday. Wasn't really into jazz dance today. Imagination Dialogue: What is it that you want? I want to Get out of this. What is this? The cycle of overindulgence, self-loathing, repeat. I want to do something meaningful. I want to feel something real, not simulated. Not something that won't fulfil my soul. Can you do this? I will act in a manner to achieve this. Mastery is nice and all but we need something more. Do what you feel is meaningful not what is expedient or sensory indulging. Good sources of meaning derive from authentic pride or mastery, love and connection, and abundance. I will look out for more of this. Don't forget your promises, you've broken them so many times. I know you don't have any reason to trust me after everything but I really regret it. Words. Words are meaningless, empty promises unless backed by action. Don't promise me anything, show it through action. Very well.

I'm thinking about dropping livestreams altogether. They are immensely pleasurable and entertaining but a larger time sink than any form of media because they don't end. A rule I've been thinking of is VoDs only. That way I have some form of control over how much media I am consuming. My research on sleep has been very enlightening. I found out some growing crisis about sleep in different age groups and possibility of illness from it. I just don't know how to condense all the material into a speech.

	4:12pm monday. Fell off the wagon again last night. Got through a workout session this morning and ate. Swept the floor. I have a twitch problem. It takes up all my time and then I punish myself for it and it's a downward spiral. I punish myself by sleep depriving myself and as I have learned, sleep is extremely importance to one's wellbeing, even more so than exercise. Today I'm going to tear down my mind and rebuild it and structure it in a way that is more orderly and hopefully prevent relapses. Honestly I've been feeling well over the past week since getting more sleep but it's mismatched against the circadian rhythm. Last night's failure was a small thought that spiraled to unfortunate circumstance. Today I saw a Jordan Peterson video about evolution and eyesight. About how we have whites in our eyes to show what people are looking at. Dopamine is release in the primal brain when someone looks at your eyes. Evolution dictated this. Humans also have particularly strong eye sight to aid at aiming since we can throw things better than any creature. Red is very attractive to us too due to the human urge to pick ripe reddened fruit over the millennia. One thing he also mention that really intrigued me was temporal resolution. Basically the refresh rate of time of someone in an accident. When your body slows down time, increases temporal rate, as you are in danger. I think this is actually possible and deserves research. It may be related to flow state. A question in need of an answer.

In the happiness course I also got enlightened on the concept of controlling internal environment rather than try to control external environment. Basically if you can control thoughts and emotions, the less things outside of yourself can influence you or you feel the need to control your environment. So a lot of the why is explained: better relationships, better mindset, better mood, better self-control. Today I hope to get into the how to control internals.

I came home and watched livestreams until I started watching porn from a trigger on livestreamfails. I notice that reddit isn't very good for my productivity in the long run. The problem I'm having is building good habits. I'm starting to get my sleep and exercise habits down but I want to build habits of authentic pride. Right now 80% of my time is spent on sensory pleasure for happiness and it is not going well. When my dopamine levels lock and cortisol appears, I don't feel like doing anything and everything becomes hazy. It's like a pre-depressive state. Some thoughts I have on change is keeping the rules but review them daily so that I don't forget. Theoretically this will be done at the end of the day where I review a past concept and one rule. Recently I have been neglecting my mind and any objectives I set for myself. Let's set a goal of 80% happiness,  20% sensory/expedience. I also added a couple of perfect songs into the playlist I've been curating these play few years.

I had a blast yesterday and today playing some WvW. We were with Crystal Desert in tier 3 versus SBI and TC. They kept trying to take smc and we farmed them just like the old days on old maguuma. I finally hit 1600 wvw rank today. Only 400 more until legendary wvw armor. I stayed up until 3 am watching TL lose to G2 in the MSI finals. It was pretty disappointing. On my sleep speech, I finished my outline and should be ready by tuesday. My sister bought food for me these past days alone at home. I'm pretty grateful. She got me some chicken tendies from Chicken Now yesterday and it was so tasty. I haven't been satisfied by chicken like that. The sauces were really good too. So about Steinbeck, I'm readying about his travels across America with Charley and put a quote of his in my speech. So far his work isn't too engaging as say Hemingway but some parts do shine. In remember him describing Deer Isle in Maine with a unique style that I could almost feel the work from the text.

What then should I do? Balance is key as they say. Perhaps stress and destressing is the way. It was not a good feeling after binging for four or five hours.. I changed my email password so I can't bypass the filter I set so long ago. The thought process behind this is to act as a wall that prevents relapses. Maybe I should write when I feel down like this. It seems to help. Back in November, my best month last year, the clarity and progress I achieved was after a bout of reflection and fueled by the 12 rules and a certain person I'll admit.

	4:01pm. Spent the majority of the day watching the great 1 million dollar race week event hosted by SunMoon. Trying to remain chill because I have a speech today I think. Weeks of research leading up to this. Yesterday I went to grandmas and Derek and I walked to half and half to get an application for his summer job. It helped me go over my speech topics and also the caffeine from the almond milk tea gave me anxiety for the rest of the night. I watched the final episode of game of thrones last night too. It wasn't the worst ending. It was fairly obvious except Bran taking the throne. Idk. It feels nice to get a conclusion but sad that the series is over and how it could have ended on a better note. Bittersweet? Wish myself confidence.

	5:15pm. Another day binging. I watched a vod of Afro's statue mime character. It was so entertaining watching people fall for his hands up act and rob. As much as I enjoy it, in the long run this isn't productive. My sleep speech yesterday went well. Manage to get the key points across but I felt like some people were lost which I took to heart too much I think. I need to practice talking for longer bout so that I can keep my mouth moist. It dries up pretty badly after four or so minutes. Feeling not too amazing atm since I binged so much gta rp for the past four hours. During my workout this morning I listened to some of Time Ferris' tips and a interview with a hardcore nutritionist/long distance athlete. They talked a bit about keto, carbs, fasting, performance. I remember reading this in the ToT few years ago. More on the tips I wrote down that in these entries I like the idea of putting reflections, priorities, and gratuity before starting my day. So far I mainly put down my reflections and thought process. Well my priorities for today is being in the moment, focused, and trusting. Don't act superior if not ironically. Get some Happiness week 5 done and read a lot more Steinbeck. Gratitude: I'm grateful for my body and it's health, my ability to get a good night's sleep, the food I enjoyed for lunch, and the brilliance of a harsh storm this noon and now a beautiful sun right now. The fun I'll be having in social dance and the friends I made/make.

	3:48pm. Spent the day procrastinating. This morning I practiced jazz steps instead of cycling. Yesterday at dance was not that amazing. We had to present but I delayed until next week. I watched stuff and then messed around with my windows theme for a few hours. Priorities.. get more productive, posture, read more. Gratuity... Health and much room to improve.

	<h1 id="134">Twenty-Five</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	4:21pm. Hit the mid twenty mark of life. Not sure if this is a milestone or what but I don't feel any difference. I notice that I complain a lot about my shortcomings and productivity in these journals and I don't want to seem like a negative person to myself. It's kind of like self abuse if your mentally brings you down in a self fulfilling manner. Instead I'll reflect on the positive and beauty of life. My health is very good. I went to class yesterday despite feeling down. Did not have any major troubles in traffic and enjoyed entertainment at very little cost. Today I read a reddit cmv about how we overlook the marvels of modern technology and living conditions and only see the negative in things. In a way this is how we improve yet it is also how we get stuck in the thought cycle of never having enough. It's the same when I spent yesterday and today changing my windows theme and trying to perfect the styling by diving into the dll files and bitmaps. One thing led to the next and I'm here changing the littlest of things like control panel side background and cursors. Once I have something, I want more. It's nice to step back and look at what we have and appreciate how far we've come rather than always obsessing over the destination. Maybe this is the moral behind Steinbeck's Travels with Charley and the goal of meditation.

	<h1 id="135">The Death of a Gnome</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	10:49pm. Really late entry today. Fell off hard yesterday. The trigger was anxiety from guild wars. My willpower was stressed after farming most of the day and then I died twice trying to get my wvw dailies. Went downhill from there. Dance in the morning was okay. Spent today recovering and watching stuff. Yesterday I also watched moonx2's last day as yung dab. He dressed as the Gnome and got caught, I guess that also contributed to my sadness. Right now I'm trying to finish the happiness course and get back on the horse. Didn't go hang out this weekend, I felt like I wanted to isolate myself. The weather has been one and off. Rainy and sunny. Not that strange for spring but a little weird for May in socal. So I just learned about dispassionate pursuit of passion; having a preferred outcome before something happens but being non-judgemental after good or bad happens. Basically not letting outcomes dictate mood but try to steer towards your preference. This is a very powerful mindset that I am going to adopt. Lately my path has been everywhere and nowhere. I simply care little for what happens and react too much to what does happen. Basically the opposite of dispassionate pursuit of passion. I think this is one of the major reasons why I am so unhappy.

	Yesterday was a good day. Did good in speech by getting things done and made the class laugh a little with my impromptu acceptance speech. After that I went to grandma's house and we went on a walk. I decided that I wanted to visit the best looking house in Monterey Park again so we walked there. It was near highland park for future reference. It turned out a little disappointing. Idk what happened but since the last time we pasted by it didn't look as aesthetic and the award was for the Beautification of Monterey Park. But I took it in stride and didn't let it affect me too much. We had some deep meaningful talks and life was good. I went home and watched the first episode of Freaks and Geeks and that was good too.

	Back to back relapses. I feel afraid and unwillingly after them. Currently binging a lot of videogames and entertainment. I understand the negative feedback loop but I let myself into it.

When I binge videogames and twitch I end up binging porn. To have a singular purpose or focal concentration help me stay on the wagon. To dance or to pursue meaning help last year. The nearly daily modern dance classes this year helped. What is my pursue that will keep me on the wagon now?

	Yesterday went quite well. I was planning on getting my id but ended up not going. I spent most of the day watching the final week of the happiness course. This week focused on mindfulness and everything about it. It helped me understand and clarified a lot of things about mindfulness and meditation. At night I played tabletop with the boys and it was actually fun rather than passive aggressive or ignorant. We played Guillotine a boardgame about the french revolution. This morning I went to jazz and put the idea of mindfulness into practice and it went well. Even though I stumbled and was self-conscious and frustrated with myself, I also caught myself many times and let the emotion pass. GATE. Goals, actions, thoughts, emotions. These are things we simply must acknowledge and let go lest they control you.

	The dance performance yesterday was incredible. Ten pieces in two hours. Showing off all types of dances, it was quite a masterpiece. I enjoyed it a lot. This afternoon I went to in-n-out to get some lunch with Chau and Jeff. It was delicious as always. We walked to Alhambra park after and looped back. We saw houses for sale and checked out the park. It's pretty nice, has a bodyworkout area, amphitheater, water area, pool and other park amenities. We also found a small gem, the Alhambra historic society. Apparently Alhambra is known for the potato chip? Good times. Then we got boba at factory tea bar, they were doing renovations to the back area. It was a little warm in there and they removed the chalk art but the music was still good.

	Yesterday after speech I went to grandmas house. On the way there was extreme traffic. Traffic the likes I have never seen in the 626. I went down Rosemead and it sucked, went on Valley and it sucked, down Walnut Grove, freeway was shutdown, alone Hellman... bumper to bumper. Near Garvey Park I said fuck it and parked there and read. I got some reading done. How a bad situation can become good. Finished Steinbeck's Travels with Charley. The book's premise and execution was technically good but I found it hard to find the meaning behind the stories. I was speed reading so a lot was lost on me but it was interesting nonetheless. Anyways the incident on the 10 freeway was an active shooter/arsonist. I was four blocks away on the other side of the freeway at Garvey Park. Helicopters galore. The swat team gassed him and lit him up. Then I went to grandmas house for Derek's birthday. Bad to good. This morning I relapsed, chaining them atm. I am finding it so difficult and empathize with people with addictions. After I practiced jazz and cut my hair to a way I actually like. Props to the dude on youtube I referenced earlier. Bad to good.

	A very thoughtful day today. I didn't do much more yesterday except finish my little commentary paper on counterpoise. Play some tabletop with Chris and Derek and went to bed. This morning I went to Jazz and it went well. We're going to perform tomorrow so that should be fun. I came home and showered and played some videogames and watched stuff. The heat got to me and I got a headache and sleep for a good hour. When I awoke there was an expensive car parked outside my room, I never did identify it but it looked pricey. I read a chapter of The Four Agreements that mentioned being impeccable with our words. Since words hold so much power and reciprocally affect our lives, it is important to choose words responsibly and without sin; intention to negatively bring others to "hell." One concept I really liked was the use of computer virus as sin words, talk, or gossip. Virus' are written in the same language just in a different pattern. Same with gossip and complaints and slander. One malicious hacker or coder can infect billions. Just look at Hitler and one has proof that hell can exist from un-impeccable (sinful) words. I then continued my happiness course on mindfulness and meditation practices. I did a 20ish minute guided practice by Vijay Bhat and actually felt something that was akin to oneness to everything. It's hard to explain but I'll follow his Presence Practice meditations some more.

	Got the dance showcase today. Spent the past day playing borderlands 2. The headhunter dlcs are pretty good for what they are. Simple and fun. The bosses at the end were pretty cool. I finished the remaining four and now wait for the new dlc. Feeling okay for the showcase today. A tiny bit nervous but I've done it before shouldn't be too bad. I put in the work and the risk is negligible. I have to remind myself that. saw a kurzgesagt video on meat. Bottomline moderation, avoid processed meats, chicken and fish are healthier. Nutrition is only part of it. The risk is almost negligible (1-2%).

	Yesterday went well. The showcase was similar to last. I performed my social and jazz alright. Got to watch some decent dancing and it wasn't too strange to transition between groups. Went home and found out bl2 dlc got released. This morning was pretty unproductive. I relapsed and didn't start my day until maybe 3pm. Just kept cycling between reddit and porn and chatting on discord. Very problematic. Slogged through a strength training in 90 degree weather and showered. It was so good. Drank fluids and watched the nba game 5 TOR v GSW. I think it hit 100 degrees today.

	Good day days yesterday and today. Went to the last day social dance party yesterday. It started pretty awkward and simply watching. I talked a lot with Deen the kid that couldn't get the steps in class. I feel him. I don't want to assume too much but I don't think he enjoyed the class as much. I sort of joined Liz and Azaelia's group most of the night. Ate and danced a little. I felt a little self-conscious and intimidated at all the brilliant dancers. Then entered Eliza. The girl from December 13th last year. She stole the hearts and minds of everyone in the room with her dancing again. I remember waltzing with her and that she started doing calculus near the end of the party last time. Anyways I talked with Azaelia's Filipino art friend forgot his name. We had a decent conversation through the night. The most memorable part of last night was the line dancing song that keeps ramping up. I actually kept up this time and that felt really good. This morning I did a bike ride in nice 70 degrees weather. After Andrew and Annie came over to get some Duck's and boba at Meettea. Caught up a bit and discussed plans for the future. After that I had my speech final and nailed it. Speech 1 was such a good class to improve myself, build confidence and improve communication in general. Such an important class imo. I appreciate you Mrs. Nelson.

Flying units really piss me off... Went to my last jazz class today. It was okay, I really felt like I grew a lot. I just regret not connecting more. Learn and grow. PS: I want to add the joke Helena told that made me laugh in such a way that  I hadn't in a awhile. We were taking a last class photo and she was laying on the floor and asked, "Are my toes pointed?"

I had trouble falling asleep last night thinking about dance and how it's over for now. This morning I went to Ritter's for lunch. A cajin/creole diner from 1995 in Alhambra on valley. Went with Chau and Jeff. We ordered the Jambalaya, Pan Roast, and Gumbo. Such good soul food. After we walked down the more ghetto side of Alhambra and chilled at a Wienerschnitzel.

It should be a fulfilling hobby. Also I noticed that my voice is really quiet and I mumble a bit. It ends up really monotone and boring.

	Dark day yesterday. Mostly gaming and binging. Two more days until Yosemite. Book on photography arrived yesterday. Aerobic training and haircut today and more Divinity. I started a new game and have been addicted since. Also today is dragon bash festival in gw2.

	Came back from Yosemite yesterday. It was a three day trip with kevin's family, kelly, annie, katie, and my parents. THe trip wasn't that bad. A lot of driving and I got to use my camera. Day one we visited the Mariposa grove and saw the sequoias. The pace of the group was kind of slow so I ditched and went up towards the Mariposa tree. A decent warmup hike. We went to an Italian restaurant DiCicco's or something after. The scarface pasta was one of the best pastas I've ever had. Day two we went into the Yosemite Valley and explored. I ditched and went up the four mile trail to Glacier point. That was a doozy. The way up was hell and down wasn't that much better. Pain everywhere vs pain on my feet. Definitely the hardest hike I've ever done so far. Said hi to a bunch of folks and talked a bit with a mountain sage who talked about his friend who was 92 and climbed a mountain formation in the distance. The way back was unpleasant. Dad went off because I came back late and drove recklessly. Soured the rest of the trip. Also bonded with the cousins and watched television/talked a lot.

	More relapses. Ate at grandma's yesterday and been exercising and playing Divinity. At Arx right now. Steven is in town. I reworked the photos to a more sustainable batch page. I found out I have a slight tendinitis on my upper quadriceps. It was from keeping my big ass phone in my right pocket while hiking on that first day in Yosemite. It's mostly gone now after almost a week. Another note, my macro extension tubes for my camera arrived. It's really macro. Even the 13mm extension is really close up. To put things in perspective I have 66 hours on Divinity within the last two weeks with a vacation.

	More divinity. I went to dim sum this morning with Andrew, Steven, Katie, and Annie. We went to the one in Atlantic square. This place is pretty good overall. The har kow had a bit too much flour and the flower tofu was dank but the rest was good. I particularly enjoyed the pot tea they had. It was very aromatic. Came home and chilled then did exercise.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	I spent July 4th finishing Divinity. The ending was fine but I had high expectations for it since everything else was so good. I spent the rest of the day looking at mods, watching streams, and playing gw2. After dinner I went to Andrew's house to hang out with his friends with Steven. We went to Banana Bay and got a drink and then went to a friend's place to play smash. Most of them were drunk and out of it already. That one drink gave me a terrible headache. When I got home around 2 am I crashed. This morning I woke up and screwed around on my phone for hours. Then ended up binging porn. Didn't do strength training and it doesn't feel good at all. I'm going to detox and return to my life now. Tomorrow I'm going to dopamine fast with so leeway so that I don't hard binge like before.

	Few hours out of my 24 hour fast. It wasn't a hard rule set dopamine fast as I did use my phone/go out but I did fast. I addressed most of the issues and pains I've been feeling the past week or so. I noticed that a lot of them could be avoided if I adhered to the four agreements. Last night Andrew was dropping Katie off at Kellys so we decided to grab food at the Barn in Arcadia. It was a good time. They ate delicious food and I smelled it. We talk about life and anime 2019. After we walked to Tripolis park and then back. I took some okay pictures. With that I think I can get my life back on track.

	Yesterday we went to little tokyo for Kelly's birthday for lunch. We visited the local plazas, grocers, weeb store, and ate at Orochon Ramen. The ramen was pretty low tier to be honest. It had bell peppers and low quality ingredients. We also went to a weeb hobby den and a beauty store. After we got boba at twinkle brown sugar. It was my first time drinking blue boba and it wasn't that great, worse than regular in fact. We went home after and was dropped off at Andrew's pharmacy. Me and Steven walked to Vincent Lugo Park via back bridge and Andrew met us there. We talked and chilled there a little and took some pictures while doing a bit of strength training with the machines there. Later we decided to eat at Ritter's for dinner and picked up Katie too. Good ass soul food to end the day.

	Yesterday I did some cycling in the heat and went to Grandma's for steak. I was feeling all over the place. Carrying around too many things and my mind was scattered. We also went on a late walk. Went to pick up Steven after to drop him off at the bus to san jose. Did that this morning. Then the loneliness hit and I binged before and during my strength training. Lead to a lot of self-contempt as I have picked up for the Drama of the Gifted Child book I've been reading. It's very abstract and obscure to me and I have trouble following the author's thought pattern and points.

	Recovering from yesterday. Tried to deprive myself of a bit of sleep so I can clock in a consistent sleep schedule. Almost done with Sleep and Gifted Child. I started DOS2 again for freetime. Playing with modded class skills this time. Yesterday they announced the switch lite and it's release date. I'm not going to get one because a used switch is cheaper and has more features and hackable. I gave Steven the old millennium falcon from years back. Lots of memories of it being passed around and collecting dust. It looks really cool put together. Oh yeah this morning after my aerobic cycling I noticed that I forgot my keys in the house. Emily's keys were for our old locks so I had to break in through my window. Apparently it's really easy to break into a house with an open window...

	I was mulling the new mobo coming to upgrade my rig soon and eventually watched a video of how the r9 290 compares to current high end gpus. Being released in 2013 and buying it for $220 in 2015 is pretty good in terms of value and performance. It is still on par +/- with the amd 570. Potential upgrades I'm looking for are the Vega 56, the rtx 2060, or the gtx 1660ti. Maybe in a year. It's hot today, currently 90F in my room. A balance patch got released today for gw2. Thieves got a new set of preparation skills that replaces traps. I tested them out this morning and visually, they are pretty cool, the seal and portal might be useful. Soon I'll be retiring my fx-8320. It's insane how much stuff I did with this cpu. Pretty much everything on my pc was computed on it for the past 4 years. This message was written on it. Incredible.

	It's been a week since my last entry. Typing this now on the new Ryzen setup. I had some minor problems switching everything so I didn't have access to this pc for a few days. So what has happened since last Friday? On saturday, I went hiking with Derek to Chantry Flats, we went on the Sturd Falls trail and Spruce campgrounds loop. It was pretty hot 80s thank god for the shade. We saw a rattlesnake on the trail at one point. It was nice to see the trail during the summer. After that we ate at a korean place and went home to recover. Dad and I went to Fontana for Nathan's birthday. We arrived late around 7ish, played with the dogs, some bball, chatted, partied with the family. Sunday I relaxed, very tired from the past day. Ended up relapsing from solitude. Monday my pc parts arrived and I spent the day assembling everything. Everything went well, there a slight hickup with the cpu mounting since I didn't know the plate was behind the mobo and it required a bit of force to screw in. Went I booted into my drive the usb drivers weren't recognized so I had to get a ps/2 mouse to login/manual install. Unfortunately the mouse didn't arrive until this morning (fri) so I had to wait five days (it was suppose to be six days so I'm glad). This week has been very hot. We're in a heat wave atm and it is constant 90s. Monday and most of Tuesday I binged hard. The heat got to me and I just wanted relief. Tuesday/Wednesday I knew I needed change so I read yourbrainonporn again and seriously tried to change. I also have been getting good meditation sessions in by vocalizing and sort of self guiding myself along. It seems to really help me get in the right state of mind and flow through. Time doesn't seem so long when I speak to myself. Wednesday and Thursday has been recovery days. I felt really tired after workouts and not too motivated but habit has carried me on. The five days without a desktop has made me appreciate the little things in life that we take for granted.

	Couple of more days. Monday. Weekends was pretty good. Chau came back Saturday so we hungout on Sunday. For lunch we ate at Aloha Factory. Had some pancakes and loco moco. Very delicious. After we picked up Daniel and went bowling at Golden Lanes in Alhambra. This is my second time bowling ever since high school so I wasn't good. Got some good pics and went to get boba at Wushiland. After we walked to Vincent Lugo via back bridge and it was awesome. Talked and shot pics and then went to the Barn for a light dinner. Some good, some bad. Doesn't matter.

	Tuesday. Festival of the Four Winds is back in gw2. Not much I really want in gw2 atm. 60 lion statue exalted shoulders mainly. Yesterday I went to grandmas and ate bun moc, bun with a bone broth and some cha and mushroom ball. It was pretty good. Walnut Grove northbound was closed so I have to go to Rosemead via Garvey. I've been playing Dishonored 2, Vallhala cyberpunk bartender, and bought cooking and mechanic simulator. I really want to play Fire Emblem Three Houses so I'll be buying a switch soon. Looking at getting the 8Bitdo Sn30 Pro+ controller that is coming out August 7th to play on. Going to also need a converter and hdmi cable. I also started a cool superhero tv show on amazon called The Boys. It's a different perspective that shows a more capitalisize superheroing and the dark side to such an alternate reality.

	Slight relapse yesterday. Not too stressed about it but still disappointed in myself and the time I lost. Had some hou theu at grandmas and it was good. Had a good strength session this morning and listened to Samy's interview on the TF show. Interesting discussions involving cyber security, hacking, and online dating. I watched Jake's vod about a gaijin conference and a harem night in a rare shibuya stream. Fun stuff. I watched the 16 min film, World of Tomorrow and had my mind blown. Obviously it's all fictional but the possibility of stuff like conciousness uploading, immortality, time travel, memory sharing is just phenomenal. The final message really resonates with me. Lately I've been in a sensory overload with videogames and web surfing. I notice that it makes me anxious and stressed so I might not play too much. My progress with the book, Understanding Exposure, has been very slow. The speed of progress also gives me anxiety.

	August. Did a bike ride in the heat this morning/noon. It was hot. Uploaded the past months photos to google photos. Almost done with Understanding Exposure. I bought my switch  yesterday. I should get here before the 9th. The shitty thing about it is that I need to buy joycons to use it. I'll order those a few days before. I've been thinking about going for some walks in the afternoon to the park. Maybe bring a book and sit on a bench and read or take photos. I realized that boys don't really socialize growing up. At least not in my experience. Girls talk about everything whereas guys just sit at home and play videogames. I'm looking in more lenses for my t3 but that will have to wait. I'm one episode from finishing The Boys on Amazon videos. The series is really good imo. The writing and cinematography is well done and tells a narrative that we do not see much in today's society. Weaponizing and marketing superheroes.

	Few updates. I received my Switch yesterday along with the joycons from amazon but unfortunately they sent me defective ones. I also mispurchased an SD card over microSD. At least I can use it for my camera. My hdmi setup is also here. To confirm the issue I went to Derek's house and hungout there at night. Yesterday I watched Spider Far From Home with Chau and Jeff. It was pretty good. Brilliant cinematography and cgi. After we went to Spring Hotpot and BBQ. $30 for all you can eat hotpot and bbq. So many options and very clean/good service. I've been listening to a book on Mindset, particularly the growth vs fixed mindset. I've fallen off the wagon a couple times this past week. Gonna keep trying.

	Lovely Tuesday. A lot of my purchases arrived by now. I am going to remodel my room a bit. The projects I have planned are a desk extension and some wall shelves. My desk is pretty restricted so I'm going to mount the power strip on the wall and manage some of these wires. I want to relocate the nx setup to the desk cabinet area for more space. With the desk extension I can remove the camera stuff on the floor and on the desk. I'm also going to move the gym equipment into my left closet since I rarely use that space and kondo marie my closet as it is chaotic as hell. With the extra moving space I'll have more accessibility to the wall shelves where I'll put my preening products, books from desk cabinet, and a peace lily plant. Raising is live plant is going to be a first for me. I've read these are pretty hardy and useful plants so I'm excited. My main concern is the AC vents that might agitate the plant. Remodel myself, the space around me, then beyond. I also cut my hair today, thinking about making tuesdays haircut days every three weeks. Parents left today to go on a vacation to Los Cubes, Mexico in the baja de california.

	Pretty good day today. I built my side desk and installed the wall shelves. It's looking really good. Most of the projects are completed physically other than cleaning the closet. It feels nice to do things yourself and appreciate the effort you put in. Been playing the switch, fire emblem three houses, the power seems to be limited but other than that everything is good. I've purchased a larger voltage charger so I can play without losing power. This means that the usb c cable I bought is kind of useless now since my phone charger can't output enough. At least I have another cable that wasn't that expensive anyways.

	Pretty great weekend this week. My room projects are done and spent the weekend connecting with friends and family. Yesterday I ate Shiki buffet with grandma and got boba at meet tea. The food didn't seem as good as before and the drink was really sweet. I watched Groundhog's Day after and it was so good. I actually cried and films never make me do that. It's my favorite movie of all time, though my library isn't that expansive. After I got an early dinner with Derek, Jon, and Will. We ate at Banchan's Takeout in Monterey Park, it's a unique spot and good food. We went to Jon's house to play boardgames and it was so much fun. There was a building chess-like game based on Greek Mythology and Settlers of Catan. Really good time. My parent returned home yesterday night. This morning we celebrated the anniversary of Grandpa's funeral. Talked a bit with the cousins about life.

	I blew it literally. Woke up this morning and messed around on my phone then got triggered and four hours later I relapsed multiple times. I think my obsession with being productive and my time wasting is leading to stress and anxiety. Playing PoGo obsessively also does not help. I watched Jake last night lateish live because he was in Water's home province of Wenzhou. Overall yesterday wasn't a terrible day I was surprised I was triggered so easily. I ate chicken and rice porridge at grandmas. In the end I think my productively kept negging at my until my resolved gave in. To correct this problem I'm implementing a no phone policy until after a goal is met. I notice the first thing I do in the morning is grab my phone and get lost playing games and browsing reddit. First thing in the morning I will unplug my phone and slide it into the cabinet. To help with my countdowns and alarms I've purchased a stopwatch, hope this helps.

	Woke up early today to get some Howlin' Ray's We waited in line for 3 hours to get our food. The most notable things there was the spice, the coleslaw, and the service. The spice was extra spicy, salty, and smokey with a southern hint and hits hard. The slaw is a nice refresher that really makes the sandwich. The customer service was really friendly and the free stuff they add to orders is nice. Overall I enjoyed it but I would only get some if someone else was waiting. An interesting experience to do if you're ever in L.A. There's lots to sightsee too. Also we learned about the local restrooms.

	Parents are out of town until Saturday. Almost relapsed again last night. Rebooting is hard. After cycling today I watched Jake's vod on Shanghai's zoo and the Russian circus. It was so fucking amazing watching the performers work. I haven't seen a circus since I was a teen and the limits of humanity being pushed by the acts are insane. Really awesome experience. After he met up with Eloise after she had disappeared from the western media. It was cool seeing her and laughing at her humor. I messed around on Reddit and watched USA nba vs Australia. It was close the first half then USA demolished them. It really got me hyped to play basketball.

His ability to see the society system is a sovereign manner is really insightful and interesting. Another thing is that I did some editing early on Chau's photo I took last month. I think it turned out really nice. I messed around and created some nameW emojis with them. Oh yeah also I've been trying to improve my grip strength by doing some timed deadhangs.

	An eventful weekend. My cousin Samantha from Australia visited this week. The interesting thing is that she is a livestreamer and instagramer. We met three years ago when we found out we were cousins but since then she's garnered quite a following. Anyways we did a bunch of touristy stuff in Los Angeles and hungout in the Arts District, Melrose, and Santa Monica. It was fun and I got to practice my photography. This afternoon she had a meet up with some of her fans and it was cool. We went to the cheesecake factory the food was pretty good and the banana cheesecake mmm. It seems stressful to be in the public eye and exposing yourself in such a way but you do make a decent amount of money. It's a tradeoff in the end. Oh yeah lcs finals game 5 right now, TL vs C9.

Yesterday I went to fencing and got introduced to that. It's a bit early but I'll manage. Me and Derek walked to JJ Boba to check it out. Things are getting a little busier now. I'm hoping to finish the edits I've been working out for photography. Fire Emblem is on hold and Gw2 had a small update yesterday and a big announcement on friday.

	First real class of fencing today. We just did warmups and footwork. I enjoyed the class. I felt a little over in-shape for it but I learned a lot. Last night I relapsed again. I was messing with the dns filters on my phone and binged. In the end I got Cleanbrowsing to work with Adguard so I'm happy about that. I'm getting better at learning to forgive myself and let go of the guilt and frustration. I'm still dealing with wrist and neck pains from sleep and desk time. The wrist pain came from no where, I assume it's from poor desk posture or sleep posture. It hurts when I rotate the forearm. Neck pain is from sleep posture. I tried the no pillow thing and it left me aching this morning so I'll see about getting a better pillow and aligning my spine before sleeping.

	Got some homework done yesterday albeit interrupted and filled with procrastination. Fencing was okay, we did a group exercise cardio by running around the room and tossing a ball back. I found it really difficult to focus yesterday. Most likely a side effect from the multiple binges. I managed to review happiness and then went to Shiki buffet with popo and family. It was good since I didn't eat my max. Took a huge dump. I finished uploading my photos for the month and editing. I learned a lot. Today I spent a good hour watching Scarra's podcast on nigahiga's youtube channel. It was very insightful on streaming culture and mindset in general.

	I haven't been doing my best recently. I feel like I'm giving 75% or less. Binged again today after fencing. Not much else going on. I finished my skyscale collection and redeemed some gem sale stuff. Did most of my homework early and did some chores. I spent a few hours looking at automatic watches, ended up saving an Orient Bambino v2. That was the trigger. It reminded me of the kpop group Bambino particularly Hadam who I've always found very attractive. Lead to some youtube videos and then pmo. Time wasters... Fencing went okay. I tried to give it 100% but not cycling has been stressful.

	Sunday afternoon watching the TSM game for third place in NA to worlds. I got into an existential peace yesterday while reading my astronomy online textbook. The universe is massive and there is so much space between everything. The concentration of our world/galaxy is a miracle. Our view of it is so limited that I'm surprised we've understood what we know so far. Yesterday I also made some Omuricesu, it was pretty good but I was hungry and it could be improved. Almost done with my FETH blue lions playthrough.

	NASA recently found a habitable super-Earth about 110 light-years away. Water vapor was seen in the atmosphere of this planet. It orbits the red dwarf star in about 33 earth days so it is extremely close, yet since the star is much older than the sun, the temperatures are cooler if not matching ours. It's crazy to think that we can get there if we discover FTL or build generational spacecrafts. I wonder what's on the planet's surface and history. Another thing that blows my mind is the fact that we are looking at pictures of it from 110 years ago since like coming here is delayed. Astounding.

	Yesterday was good. I did my workout and studied and played Fire Emblem. Astronomy was pretty cool. The lecture was focused on the moon relation to earth and light. The idea that light is a wave and a wave is based on its frequency was astounding. I had a slight stomachache at night though. This morning's class went pretty good. I got mock knighted as a king. I was feeling pretty good until I finished my haircut and morning routine. I decided to play the new GW2 update and got about half way then my pc blue screened. It left me with a headache and stress and then a relapse. Three important things I want to recap is that I deviated which led to stress. Another thing is that I spend over 40% of my computer time on entertainment, gw2/twitch/etc... Trying to lower this and focus on reading and learning. Finally the days of the week are named after the solar system. Moonday, Marsday, Mercuryday, Jupiterday, Venusday, Saturnday, Sunday.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Yesterday I went to the first astronomy lecture at PCC. It was about the cosmic dawn period. The whole lecture was mind blowing. The speaker was an astronomer whose focus was on the remnants of past stars. He first showed us the scale of the observable universe. I like the analogy he used on the neurons in the brain per person representing a star in a galaxy and 100 billion people being the amount of galaxies in the universe. It was also quite intriguing to know that after the big bang, heavy elements weren't a thing yet. Heavy elements only started to occur after supernovea explosions of stars. These star deaths can potentially produce a small long living star or a large star that will explode younger. By find stars with little heavy elements we can conclude that they are extremely old stars. Another way we can study old stars is by looking at very faint starlight and calculate the distance the light wave traveled. By relating the travel time with the current time we can potentially being seeing stars that are billions of years in the past (cosmic background radiation). Another interesting thing I learned from the lecture was that it took about a second for light to reach the moon, 8 mins to the sun, 5 hours to pluto. The scale of everything is insane. Finally the topic on dark matter was briefly clarified to me when the speaker said that it's the stuff beyond the universe, so I think that if we imagine our universe as a computer program, the universe and space is 1's and 0's, something and nothing. Dark matter is the reality beyond it. Our reality ("darkmatter") versus digital reality (observable reality). The James Webb space telescope launching in 2021 will bring more clarity to what we know now.

	It's been a pretty moderate couple of days. Little ups and little downs. Sunday I spent most of it doing astro homework and consuming media. Moon day I had my class, we learned more about light and telescopes. I got to see different telescope types and go up to the PCC Observatory. Mars day I had fencing and it was okay. We practiced our lunges and forms. I played a lot of gw2 recently. I spent a good amount of time looking for duels and wvwing. Maguuma has dropped in tiers but the pugs are still the free thinking yolo cancer I love. I went on a insane binge last night until 5 am. I realize this problem has been going on for such a relatively long time. I looked at my google activity and tried to delete porn activity that dates back to 2011 since I created that google account. My phone is such a huge problem since I was able to mostly remove it from my pc. Anyways today I've been trying to equalize my internals and did some homework.

	Strange couple of days. After my workout on Moon day I was hit with a fever during my post workout vulnerable period. Chills, headaches, and weakness. I still went to class but it was painful. I slept early and got some good foods, probiotics, antioxidants, fluids, and painkillers. It was mostly gone yesterday evening. I had trouble with getting my Steam to run on my pc all night yesterday. It was soo aggravating. Today I did a weightless workout and after found the solution to my Steam issue, apparently it was because my xbox controller was connected and the service/program was interfering with Steam's launch... So stupid. I saw the answer last night when someone mentioned that their joystick was the problem but I didn't attempt it...

Yesterday/Sun Day we went to the movies again. We watched Joker (2019). This extra keyboard space will take some time to get used to. Anyways the film was good.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	I feel very hedonic recently. I've spent a fair deal on myself this year and enjoy it but I'm always craving more, not entirely satisfied with what I have. Keyboard, camera lenses, watches, swords, clothes, switch.. Always wanting more. I need to be more grateful with what I have. Appreciate and be compassionate for when I did not have these things. Do not forget the past when things were without these things. Typing on this keyboard is so satisfying. I've still been having trouble with my addiction periodically. I cut my hair this afternoon. It's getting to the point where it is covering my eyes. It's kind of annoying but I'll get used to it until I can tie it into a bun. Astronomy has been great, I've learned a lot about the solar system and our place in it relative to everything else. The space between everything frightens me. The scale of the observable universe is so anxiety inducing and things like the great attractor instils great curiosity in me. On a tragic note, my uncle passed away on Sun Day. Jenny and Lucy's dad. May their family find peace in the ever fluctuating chaos of life in impossible odds.

	Busy couple of days. Spent this last weekend doing homework and going to family things. On Sunday I picked Steven up and we went to Uncle Lin's visitation. A lot of people showed up and it was pretty cool. On Monday we did the rights and cremation. After we went to a buffet and then the malls. After I went to astronomy. We learned about the scale of the solar system and the vastness of space relative to actual scaled down models of the planets. It went pretty well and I had a slight existential crisis. After we got pizza and hungout at Jenny and Lucy's house. We talked until 3 am. This morning I went to fencing and had my first bout. I got destroyed. I missed most of my advances and got parried riposted two or three times. I'm kind of stressed and disappointed from that but I'll get better. A lot of my stuff I ordered arrived including my foil so I'll practice and improve.

	It has been a disastrous couple of days. I am sleeping and waking very late. These past days I've been binging after I've learned of some loopholes. My computer has been blue screening very frequently everytime I play a game. I am feeling out of it and not in the most present state of mind. I'm still getting my schoolwork done but at the bare minimum and neglecting personal work. Riotgames recently announced a plethora of new games and updates. It's rather ambitious. The Kindle paperwhite I bought last week arrived today. I'm looking to increase my reading and lower my consumption of media and entertainment. I was listening to a TF podcast with the gamer phd researcher who broke her head. She has a rule that stated that 21 hours of videogames per week is the max one should spend before it becomes detrimental to their quality of life.

	Sun Day. I finished the main story of me2 today. It's very good at creating relatable and impactful characters through unique dialogues. I think my favorites are Thane and Samara. In terms of loyalty mission, Tali's with Legion is the best. Legion's character is so unique and theoretically astonishing. Close seconds are Jack, Grunt, Mordin, Miranda, and Kasumi. I'm going to finish up the dlcs and move onto me3. In league of legeneds worlds news, NA is officially out for knockout stage this year. Only CN, EU, and KR are left. I hope SKT wins now. Yesterday we celebrated Ryan's birthday at his house. There were less cousins this year because of college and recent events. Everyone busy and whatnot. We played some old wii games that got us talking about Lord of the Rings and nostalgic stuff in general. Right now I'm reading about the Sun for Astronomy, it's a little dry or maybe because I feel really hazy today. But yeah, all the energy on Earth is thanks to the Sun. It's really incredible we can exist so harmoniously with such a powerful entity.

	Time really flies. It's day six of my recovery. I'm feeling really good. My brain fog is lifting and I do feel more social and motivated. It seem my dopamine levels are stabilizing. Day seven is tomorrow, I am looking forward to the increase in testosterone. Astrology was fun, we learned about the asteroids and comets and their fields, the asteroid and kuiper belts. It still boggling to me the vast distances of space. Yesterday we visited Kevin at UCR because he was dealing with family issues and reached out to us. Apparently he was in a relationship and his father exploded sending him disturbing and threatening text messages along with the verbal yelling. We got dinner at an Indian restaurant in Riverside and let Kevin vent and gave advice/support. It was fun and emotional. I'm glad we have such an even tempered generation in this family. The food and service was also very good.

	Day Eight. I've made it a week for once in a long while. The benefits have been significant. The fog has mostly cleared and my thought processes are responsive. I went hard in my fencing bouts in the heat and strained myself a bit. At least I did my best and got good practice. CIS went well, I made conversation and was quite witty. Day 7 I didn't really go out but I felt a bit more in control of my emotions and productive in regard to reading. Yesterday I was plagued by blue screen of death issues. Nothing seems to fix it. So the last resort is coming. After my me3 playthrough I'm going to clone my drive, wipe it, and install windows 10. Hopefully the free install works and the reinstallation of years of programs won't take too long. To we're celebrating grandma's birthday at Newport Seafood.

	It's the more spookiest time of the year. I went on a horrid binging spree on Tuesday and relapsed. Back to day 2. The blue screen of death issue was becoming more and more frequent until it would crash every 20 mins. I could bare it anymore and pulled the plug on the windows 10 upgrade. As of last night I am on windows 10 and I was quite surprised with the process. I thought that I would have to do a clean install but it was almost seemless and free. My win 7 license simply transferred over. There was a slight hiccup after the installation where I couldn't login and after I installed a theme and updated everything another issue came up. Other than those problems I was happy that all my files were intact. The bsod problem disappeared and for future reference: this monitor or gpu has trouble running at 144hz, THERE WILL BE FLICKERING SO BE WARNED. Also I won all my bouts today for saber fencing.

I've been getting into Tara Brach's 40 days of mindfulness meditations and it has been helping me be more aware of the present. The brain fog is lifting and I'm getting in more control. The previous world champions of LoL, IG have been knocked out of contention. I spent a good deal of time researching and purchasing perfume, EDP, to be exact and finally purchased one and a sampler. Not the best use of my time and money but I've been distracted by fashion and fragrance recently and it helps me keep, scratch that it's a mindless distraction at best but if it brings me some joy then I think I can forgive myself.

My spending has been a bit extreme recently. Bought a wide angle, leather sneakers, and some perfume. My pc was locked out yesterday when I couldn't login. I had to load the clone on my hdd running win7 and hive regedit the shutdown back on the win 10 os so I could access the custom boot menu. Really stressful stuff. I finished mass effect 3 and man the ending is so disappointing and frustrating. I hate the fact that you have to repeat the unskippable end cutscenes to get to the ending. Besides that the dlcs and story wasn't bad and the gameplay is definitely the best in the series.

	Pretty productive past few days. I finished three books in a close span of time. Oathbringer was quite epic. We had my sister's birthday yesterday at 888 Seafood on Valley again. It wasn't as good serice and food wise. We went to AU79 after and got boba and then went bowling. I managed to learn how to throw a scuffed curved ball and it was fun. After I did some chores and chilled for the rest of the day. Unfortunately this meant I felt lonely and restless. Started scrolling LSF and /r/all and it all went downhill from there. Relapsed and binged quite heavily. Shit. I think my main concern is that I'm not consistent with my sleep schedule and not really focusing my resources towards a specific career capital/life mission. This is something I've tried to think about but always end up avoiding. Ultimately I think I want to expand the field of astrophysics since it has catapulted humanity in such an extremely trajectory since the discoveries about the electromagnetic spectrum. There has to be more to this universe that we haven't found yet.

It's quite possible though, I can envision a life like that. It makes be miss college/dorm life. Today while cycling a car ran a red light as I was crossing the intersection. Had I been a little faster, I could've been hit and at those speeds, I don't know. I understand human error but if they hadn't braked, a collision was imminent.

	The weekend was fun. We went bowling and then ate at John's Kabob. Mediterranean food is filling and delicious. We went to Honeyboba after and chatted. Nice area and nice time together. I finished Persona 3; the social links and narrative were really good. The gameplay was okay, I liked the persona raising and combining aspect of the game. I spent more timer on the game than I thought which is a sign that it was fun. I had asatro yesterday and we learned about the death of stars, neutron stars and black holes. The idea of relativity and space time was introduced briefly. It is still an abstract concept but very interesting. Large mass collisions affect gravity in astounding ways. The guest speaker talked about black holes and how they exist in most galactic centers, surrounded by the most stars in the galaxy. Another concept that intrigued me was the fact that if you could somehow fall into a black hole and be alive, you'd see the past before you. I theorize that you'd be blinded by photons no? Also what if their were a class of black holes that are above supermassive. Ones that literally pull entire galaxies in the center of the universe. Fun stuff.

	Tuesday I did fencing and it was alright. I tried my best and learned that my accuracy needs work. We ran on the track and it motivated me to improve my running. Apparently cycling does not translate straight into running. Recently I've been trying to stay in the present. Naval Ravikant's talk really opened my eyes and motivated me to evaluation my waking state of mind, mindfulness, being awake and present, enlightened. Yesterday I relapsed and binged after finishing my homework. The trigger was loneliness and empathizing with Shiphtur's team losing scrims. It sounds dumb now that I think about it but at the time I felt weak and vulnerable and there was a extremely powerful craving in my upper chest and throat that compelled me beyond reason and control. My solution for this problem in the future is to taper off my computer usage and have it on only when I am using it for something productive or an allocated playtime. I've also been reading into Einstein's Childhood and early years. Some key points I would like to emulate is his suspicion of authority and curiosity. Many would think of him as a lonely genius but Einstein actually had close associates and life-long friends. He spent a great deal of time in his studies but he was also outgoing in regards to music, playing the violin outside whenever he got the chance.

	Had a couple of days to recover. I got triggered a bit today even though it mostly went well. Friday and Sunday was decently productive. I got time to relax and balance everything. On Saturday I went hiking with Chau and Jeff at Chantry Flats. We went relatively hard and decided to hike to Mount Zion. Roughly 10 miles give or take. Nice and easy miles, shaded with good elevation contrasts. The best thing about the hike was the Sturtevant camp ground where we discovered a community mess hall with entertainment and kitchen. It was extremely cozy and instilled in me an idea of getting a cabin in the woods. We spent nearly an hour playing there. I will definitely be back. We got to the summit afterwards, not the most climatic thing in the world but at least it wasn't demotivating like Yosemite. When we finally got down at around 5 pm we went to Oo-KOOK kbbq and went ham on it. A fitting end to the perfect day.

	Day after Thanksgiving. This year didn't go so well. It has been raining a lot these past few days. I didn't get to go cycling because of it and things just snowballed from there. I don't want to talk about the negatives and how things went from as I think it puts me in a poor mindset. Rather I'll reflect on the failures and move on. Basically a habit was missed and I spent the day playing videogames. Fun but unproductive. Dissonance. The dinner itself was with food I didn't particularly enjoy, too much fried and dry foods. I complained a fair bit. Not my best self. Took things too personally. Criticized. Ended the night with a nasty binge... So to learn and improve, fuck the weather. Rain or shine just do it.

	Couple of days since my last entry. I'm going to keep it daily like I used to do. The thanksgiving break flew by like a haze. It was not the best but not the worst. I had a relapse streak. I haven't been feeling consistently focused during that time. Saturday night I hung out with Steven. We went to Walmart and Diner on Main. We chatted and had some deep conversations. It was good. I had a lot of mac and cheese. Yesterday was the last day of astronomy, Professor Hartman crammed in a lot of material. Blackholes, local clusters, laniakea, dark matter, dark energy, theories, and more. It was a great lecture. I really enjoyed the class. This morning I went to fencing and had an epee bout with the coach. It was pretty close and motivating. Finals soon.

	Thursday afternoon. I spent most of yesterday watching gta rp again. Cyr/Uchiha started a new character named Vincent Hunt, a parody of the Tom Cruise, Bourne, Bond type character. He was trying to become a police cadet and had to wait for a FTO for a ride along. It was interesting watching a perspective of a lowly law enforcer. Today I nearly overslept and missed fencing. We had an epee tournament today. I went 3-1. With pretty strong challengers. After my second bout my sword arm felt tired and weak. I need to practice more swordsmanship and arm endurance. Didn't feel 100% focused because I was thinking about my forearm. I think I should've won if I landed the 3-2 on Jonathan Hyleck. I think I have a counter for the high arm stance that has been getting popular. A downward slap, if I miss they'll lunge and I can do my speed check lunge. If I land it, go straight for a lunge speedcheck as they recover. I think this way I'll double or first hit. Just make sure to dodge as quick parries.

	Not a bad day today. After the debacle yesterday I went to sleep late and woke up poorly. I did manage to read more and get a few things done. I listened to the TF podcast with Wim Hof. I love this guy. The iceman. He was very interesting in that he gave me a new perspective on controlled breathing and how it can impact your bodily systems, even those such as the nervous and endocrine. I hadn't thought about the way breathing can affect systems beyond the muscular and cardiovascular. It has potential to change neurons in the brain and the release of hormones and neurotransmitters. Very interesting stuff. Wim talked about controlling the immune system and the body's impact reaction to extreme temperatures and emotional trauma. After that talk I felt a lot better and curious to improve my circumstances through these good thoughts and actions.

	I'm having trouble sleeping and waking with the Sun. This past weekend was productive and problematic. I went to the doctors for a checkup and blood work. I did a bit of reading and relapsed saturday night. Tomorrow would be day 60 if I kept up but this addiction is strong. I felt a bout of stress replacing my bike tires and tube on saturday. It took longer than expected and I biked in the dark. Note to self, avoid cycling at night with traffic aka 4-7 pm. I was almost hit yet again. Recently I've been learning about the primitive brain or the base/stem region that is also known as the reward circuit. It is basically the feeling part of the brain responsible for hormones and emotions. A lot of research and personal experience has led me to conclude that this part of the brain cannot be suppressed or ignored. It will manifest itself and lead to addictions, imbalances, and illnesses. It can however be managed and controlled or at least work in conjunction with the neocortex/prefrontal cortex (PFC), the logical brain. Finding balance is important when using these two areas of the brain. Allowing the primitive to help you endure and find comfort in extreme stress and hardship while using the PFC to focus and guide it is an important concept for living and being human in general. How to do this is with controlled breathing practices that will affect the other systems of the body and good balanced diet, regular exercise, and consistent sleep to have energy and nutrition to maintain health and mental stability. Another aspect I found useful is experience extreme stress regularly but safely to train yourself to be confident in discomfort. An easy way to do this is take a shower with the temperature cranked to max coldness or do pushups without breathing.

	<h1 id="249">Losing</h1>
	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	A theme of late is winning and losing. It seems that it is the only thing that matters in life in some perspectives. The Laker and Bucks just lost their winning streaks and it must not feel good. As a competitor they might feel devastated. More recently I've been taking loses more gracefully. When one can view loss as a benchmark for improvement it becomes a win. Let me tell you a story I heard from the great Dave Chappelle. There was a black kid from Chicago in the 1950s who went to visit his relatives in Mississippi for summer vacation. His ma told him not to look at any white folks in the eyes. Now we know how different things are in Chicago. Black kids growing up in the north don't have the fear instilled in them like those in the south. The boy was Emmett Till. He was beat up and lynched for flirting with a white woman. Till's mother insisted on a public funeral with a open casket. This boy's murder was the catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. A loss resulting in a win. It's important to take the good from the bad. If you're staring at an elephant a foot away, you'll will only see a part of it. If this white woman did not lie about being advanced upon with, the movement may have not taken off. An analogy may be said about Trump's presidency. I think to myself, this one man somehow garners enough mutual dislike from the American people to band them together against him. He's giving us something to relate each other to and that is the silver lining, the bright side, the good from the bad, the win from the loss.

	<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
	Wednesday. I am picking up cousin Karen from LAX tomorrow. That will be interesting. Today while working out and listening to the TF podcast, I listened to the cartoonist whose affirmations became reality. A sort of self-hypnosis of sorts. This older gentle was quite interesting in that he had interesting stories and he himself was an excellent story teller, always having a tale to tell to explain ideas and concepts. One that really resonated with me was the idea that some unknown outer force is compelling us, that we have no free will. However if we decide to write affirmations, it is basically this outside programmer, programming the character, us, to write it's own fate. Perhaps this is how this universe is ran. Food for thought.

	Yesterday I went to LAX and picked Karen up. It was a long day in traffic. I spent 6 hours driving just in LA. Really stress inducing. We got to Andrew's house and went to eat. When I got home I was tired of driving. Willpower is really a thing. Willing myself thoughout the day I didn't have much left in the tank. My habits carried me on but mainly the bad ones. The day did not end well. But I think I did okay as a driver and host that day.

Yesterday I went to the Scottish temple in Pasadena to volunteer for Project Santa with the family. Afterwards we went to Yes Sushi for ayce and then Onezo then chilled at Lucy's house.

	It has been a great Christmas these past days. Operation Santa was awesome. I helped a 68 year old man who has been doing it for 20 years. He was a funny and zero filter gentleman who gave good advice along with funny remarks. The delivery themselves were relatively easy. We had a well off neighborhood with big parties. The no boomer party was awesome. We shared laughter and joy. Yesterday we had Christmas at grandma's and it was okay. I'm really low energy from all the celebrating and lack of sleep.

	The majority of my time has been on reading about Einstein and mhw these past days. I'm also watching the Witcher series on netflix. It is really well made but has timeline issues. The characters and universe really makes me want to reread the books and replay the games. The show really goes over keys parts of the books that is glossed over in the games. Also I really admire Einstein's pacifist views and his views on individual freedom and socialism. I think he is very idealistic about human nature and society. Almost naive to a fault but admirable nonetheless. It reflects my own views on humanity but I don't think true pacifism is possible. It goes against human nature and we have all experienced its uncontrollable aspects to truly contain it. I also agree with his super idealist view of a super globalized nation where no single nation has sovereignty over its people. A democratic superpower who utmost goal is to protect the creative liberties of its people. For me personally I think a socialistic approach is more beneficial as we have seen the disparity in capitalistic nations.
