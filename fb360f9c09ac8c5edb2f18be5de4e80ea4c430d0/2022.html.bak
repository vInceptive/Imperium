A couple of days back from holiday leave. I'm going to nevermind...I was trying to write neatly so I can just OCR these entries but my writing is too sporadic. I guess to catch up on the past few weeks. Graduation was on Dec 15th. Mom and dad visited and we went to sushi and costco. It was weird walking around in my dress blues. At night we went to the hotel and ordered deep dish pizza from Lou Malnati's. It was so god damn tasty. Later that night we packed all our things and got on bus for 20 hours down to Pensacola. We had like 18 tech rates on the bus so it wasn't that bad. A lot of sleeping. Th following week we went on leave. Going back home was very nice and also cold and wet. Ate a lot, hungout with the cousins at the mall and KBBQ. We also watched Spiderman, the one with the clashing multiverses. Coming back I missed my flight and had to be on standby for two flights which I stayed overnight for. Thee was a shipmate who was in a similar situation and we got onto the same flight from Dallas Fortworth to PNS. For the past week we did more processing and indoc. Went into the compound/skiff? for the first time. Our group is 15 strong and I'm currently in life skills classes atm.

Monday. It has been a fast couple of weeks. So a lot of this month has been chilling doing quals and watches. We finished processing and are awaiting classup. Getting all these signatures have been a pain in the ass but it's mandatory to phase up. Our group, the USS Kittyhawk is simply the best. We're now 11 strong since 4 of our CTNs have classed up. I love our group. Really mature and like minded people. Most of us have phased up already except for me, Byrd, and Oki. At 1095 we stood watches everyday last week. The kittyhawk is AD1's favorite we never make trouble, uniforms are always on point, and we clean very well. On friday we moved out of 1095, I'm now in the ghettos (3708). It's not bad here. The internet is slow but at least it's consistent and usable. I have everything setup on my laptop I bought. It's been a bit hectic but nice. I had two night watches back to back this weekend so my sleep has been strange. The group of sailors after us are pretty cool 50/90/70 strong. 1095 is fully packed that's why we moved out so promptly. I'm basically done with my quals, just awaiting a DSL signature and to copy and turn in. I finished reading 1984 during my stay in 1095. It gets so good after reading Obrien's book and getting caught by the thought police. The book capsulates the ideas I research in highschool about the evolution towards collective thought. Another book I've started reading is Sapien—A Brief History of Humankind. Very thought provoking and perspective shifting. The folks in my group are Amaya, Ayala, Byrd, Chavarria, Dickey, Huerta, Leigcht, Mawhilec Mcvay, Okitikunda Steen, Siegfried, Simones, Ramos. I finished a couple of shows too. The Witcher season 2, Invincibles s1, Arcane s1, and the Expanse s6.

Saturday of a lovely week. This past week I was in alpha phase but not really doing anything other than muster in the mornings and nights. It was great. Now I'm phased up and wearing civies. I've started playing hollowknight and it's pretty good. I really enjoy the mechanics and boss fights. Since I phased up I went out with the hawks last night. We got pizza and went bar hopping in downtown Pensacola. It was fun but drinking isn't really my thing and it was cold af. Apparently us ct mikes might class up on the 7th. I can't wait to start learning stuff.

It's thursday. Yesterday was twosday (02/02/22). We'll be getting another one at the end of the month. This week is my first and hopefully only week in n92 working party. It's not terrible but the mustering three times a day is a bit annoying. The work we do isn't even really work. Basically picking up leaves and trash. I finished Hollow knight and got the bad ending and started Ruined King. RK is a turn based rpg wet dream. I'm really enjoying it but it's not as complex or indepth as something like DOS2. The weather has been hot and cold really all over the place. Windy/rainy. Today I have duty driver watch 1200-1800 this will be fun, I'm excited to drive around. This will be my first watch so I hope it goes swimmingly. In FEH I'm trying to +10 Volke with my massive 7k orbs and my luck has been average. A lot of unit not named Volke but it is what it is. I've been getting into a routine of waking up and getting chow then mustering. Getting more acclimated with change. Still reading Sapiens, currently on the part about how three things unite humankind: empires, money, and religion. The navy is akin to this idea, a faction with its own laws and ideologies on top of the earning of money/trust.

<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
Today was quite a strange day. The weather has been rainy and cold in pensacola. So we classed up today and I've finally started A school. Unfortunately we weren't told until literally this morning. I was on echo spotter watch and they relived me to go on a wild goose chase to find my class. Eventually I got to the compound and the right classroom to join my class of 10 lol. We started talking about anime and dnd and nerd shit the entire time. Cool bunch since half of us are kitty hawk. <br> Yesterday I went hiking with Byrd and Chav on the swamp trail next to the base. It was short and nice and sketchy at the same time. It was nice to be away for civilization again but it was also in the ghettos so we heard gunshots which was quite unsavory. After that we got japanese food at Kyoto near base which was super subpar and then went shoppingat the mall. That was probably the most fun I ever had shopping at the mall. We went to a bunch of stores and looked at weeb shit and got fake boba. I ran into Padilla briefly and got dinner at Whataburger. The specialty burgers were good and the spicy hotsauce ketchup was fire but the rest was pretty meh especially since the milkshake machine was broken and they ran out of avocados.

It's friday and the first week of class is over. The pacing of class is kind of fast but the material is familiar. We've covered operational risk management and direct current and numerical units so far. Everyone in the class is super cool with the exception of Gary who doesn't seem so bad just a little misguided. We have a person in our class, Womack, who seems to be failing upwards. He received a 98 on the DC test apparently since he is retaking this section again but he never recalled taking it in the first place. Today is gets talked to about receiving a bravo zulu because he did so well on his polygraph. So ridiculous. Like how do you do well on a polygraph that the proctor calls your superior to tell them this. Speaking of superiors, we met CTM1 Clark the yesterday. He seems like a chill yet intense guy. He's seen some shit. He talked about how CTMs can be anywhere and the special places we can work got me really hyped. Some secret agent shit, three letter agencies and stuff the public doesn't even know about. I'm feeling extra motivated to do well now. Classmates: Gary, Prinzi, Chavarria, Womack, Anderson, Tomas, Mcvay, Okitakunda, Byrd.

It's saturday. Last week went by very good. I got a 94 on my dc test. It was fun studying and going to classes with everyone. We went to waffle house on valentines day and my mechanical keyboard setup is here. I've been playing a bunch of lost ark. The combat and mechanics is so fun. This weekend is a long weekend and my roommate moved out so I have the room to myself. Yesterday we had warrior day and it was more fun than I thought. We sat around and chilled watching people play sports. The weather was windy and cold in the morning but cleared up and we got a nice amount of sun. It was nice hanging with Kittyhawk again. I ran in the 5k and thoroughly enjoyed it. The ctm gang is pretty cool. We took second in the tug o war contest against the CTTs. We talk about the strangest and random things in class which makes it all the more interesting. Life on corry station isn't so bad, it's like a paid vacation to be honest. There's a bunch I want to do here before I go and it seems I'll have a lot of time to do it. Our graduation from A school is May 9th. Hooya ctms.

It has been a slow week. I played a lot of Lost Ark doing dailies, quests, raids, and pvp. The four day work week was a slog. Having no roommate isn't the best for me. Too much privacy leading to relapses. Classes have been fun, we're really tight as a class and I'm opening up a bit. Our AC test was on friday and two of us did not pass and two others are on mandatory study. Fun. In other news, Russia has invaded Ukraine and I'm feeling down and stressed I think... Today I failed two enhances on my weapon and ragequit Lost Ark. Next week End of Dragons is releasing so at least there's that. It's currently Saturday night and today has been a mixed day. I guess your mood is how you want it to be. To a better me.

Hump day. We had our comms knowledge test today and it was pretty bad. 6/9 of the class is on mando now and I'm barely passing. The weather here has been really good though. Low seventies. I've been getting stronger with my calisthenics from incorporating the weight belt into my lifts. End of dragons came out yesterday and the pocket barrier specter build is kind of overpowered. It's not very good as a power dps but it is fun to play in wvw. I haven't touched the story at all but it seems okay. I got the Hifiman he400se's now and it's good but I'm not blown away at the sound as I was with the Philips x2s. I'm purchasing an amp/dac for the headphones to see if I can unlock its full potential. The planar tech's clarity is astounding though. The funny thing is that we're learning about the crypto/comms systems right now and it included an amplifier and loud speaker system that I'm trying to set up with these headphones. There's a renaissance fair this weekend and I'm hoping to go. I'm feeling a lot better today. I'm well rested and exercised. I also got my new roommate today. Seems like a nice guy. Good stuff.

Finished the week out strong. Our comms troubleshooting went very well. We went to Panera bread after to celebrate and ate tons of pizzas and foods. We went to the mall afterwards and got boba. It was eh. Yesterday we went to the renaissance fair to eat fried food, check out the tents, and watch jousting. It was pretty scuffed but not a bad time. I ate fried gator and fried oreos for the first time. It was super dusty and hot. We also had mandatory PT on thursday. A lot of people were humbled by it. People feeling like throwing up left and right. I am currently listening to the TF podcast with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and he's talking about leaving home and growing up fast and really enjoying New York. I really relate to that as I am in Florida experiencing a different perspective of America. Different environment, politics, ideas, people, etc. This second college I'm experiencing is really dejavu. Studying for this course and reliving college life in general is a strange yet nice experience. I'm really liking the fast pace and applications the course instills into the job of a ctm. The handson stuff is what I wanted back in college. Another thing Levitt talks about is intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation. Things like fame, money, power doesn't really affect my decisions in life as much. I'm very intrinsically motivated compared to a lot of people and my peers. I notice it hits hard when they compared themselves to others and get an ego check.

Very wet week. We had showers all week, thankfully it was a four day  week. Unfortunately I failed my test equipment test by one question so I'm on mandatory study now. Damn I felt so bad that day. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. I'm starting to figure out how these tests are structured; I need to really pay attention to what Mr Lowell tells us to study before the test and really focus on those specific topics. It's just brute memorization and answering the questions. Yesterday I went to watch the new Batman movie. It was alright. Kind of cliche and not as dark/gritty as the dark knight. I was falling asleep through the slower parts of it. We got chief's talk on thursday. It was great, we were talking about anime and videogames. I don't know if I should continue going so hard on Lost Ark. I'm spending too much time and attention doing dailies and the time to get good at pvp is catching up to a point where I need to spent a ton of time away from study and gw2 to get good. I'm also on the last episode of demonslayer entertainment district arc. It's so good. I finished samurai champloo and that was great too.

It's saint patty's day. A sunny thursday in florida. Class has been going good. Time has been flying and we're close to finishing comms. We had a mock prt yesterday morning at 5 am and it was the first time I broke 10 mins for the mile half. We got our dream sheets to pick what C school we want and where we might be stationed. In class today we watched Carrier the documentary and it kind of made me not want to go on an aircraft carrier. Too many people. Tomorrow we're gonna go eat together at Crackershack? Idk some southern place, hope it's good. At night we're planning on watching Jujutsu Kaisen 0 movie. It's going to be great. Last comms test to get off mando. Hooya. The blue angels flew over us on wednesday and it was the first time being under one of those things. Man they make so much noise and the sound waves really reverberate your body.

Sunday. Friday was nice. I made a 95 on our last test equipment test. We got out early and made it back before the thunderstorm hit. It was crazy for about an hour then the storm stopped. Classic Florida. We went to Cracker Barrel to get some southern food. The southern fried chicken was so good. A little drizzle of syrup and mac n cheese. Whew. Went to workout afterwards in the semi sunny afternoon and did my first pullover. It was great. We watched jujutsu kaisen 0 late at night and I fell asleep. It's not bad so far but I'm not blown away by it. I started end of dragons and I'm enjoying the world and story. It's a bit empty but New Kaineng oh my.

I finished Jujutsu kaisen. It was alright, I wanted more. This past week was super chill. We got a dress white inspection yesterday. It was so scuffed. We got to the compound with them on hangars and had to go back and store them. We did practicals all week and graded ones on thurs and friday. I did pretty well. We went to ayce sushi yesterday at sushi masa and it was really good. Sushi really hit the spot after so long without asian food in general. I'm spending so much this month for some reason. I've spent almost $800. Goal for April: spend less. Also the dust in the air is killing me. I've got the worst sniffles. I just had dinner and it was great. The chow hall is really growing on me. I'm trying to read a certain amount of pages a day to get the habit down. We're going to start ITE on monday, lets go.

Thursday. We started ITE in ctm a school. It's a lot of self studying/teaching created by cisco. It covers a lot of the basics and goes indepth on a lot of things even outdated things. All this staring at computer screens all day is taking a toll on my eyes. I just want to rest my eyes and sleep by the end of each day. There have been storms in the night but the days have been warm. Super adeventure box festival started in gw2 and I'm trying to get some of the skins. It's been mildly infuriating. On tuesday we had mando pt and CTM1 Brooks really worked us. My legs are still sore from that.

Tuesday. Dinner at Carrabas as okay. The food was okay but we had a good time anyways. A lady paid $100 off our bill and the dessert was good. The weekend was okay, I think I picked up a cold. The dust is still killing me. We also got a health and comfort inspection yesterday. I barely passed somehow even with black mold. It's raining atm and I'm hoping to go for a run before dinner. I'm close to finishing Sapiens, on the chapter about happiness in human history. The author makes a good point in how wars have become mutual communal suicide thanks to science and capitalism. How we're never in international war anymore thanks to intertwined imagined communities, moving from familial communities. Communities based on habits and interest and promoted by the state. The social order has been a state of constant flux and change, for example the Internet from 90s to now. The seven decades after WWII have been the most peaceful era in human history with exponential economic and political than any era. In the years following 9/11 the average person was more likely to kill himself than to be killed by a terrorist, soldier, or drug dealer. War had become less lucrative and peace prospers thanks to international connections and dependence. It makes me look into the invasion of Ukraine and how tied up Russia is.

Sunday. An okay week. We went to a food truck festivals yesterday and it was pretty good. I got some really spicy pad thai. We're finishing up ITE chapter 1-9 and testing next week. Been doing gw2 SAB festival dailies and trying to find some games to procrastinate with. I've started Tokyo Mirage Sessions FE on the switch. It's basically persona with a new skin. I've been watching Rainbow the anime about seven kids in juvenile prison and the bond they form over time. It's good. I gotta stop relapsing. It completely ruins my hormone state and body's chemical balance. That's something that was covered in Sapiens, in which pleasure and pain is all a balance of chemicals in the body and that leads to happiness, sadness, motivation, laziness etc. Sapiens is a very good book that explains the history, present, and future of humankind. Nathan went to prom on friday. Damn I'm getting old.

Last week has been relatively good now that I think back upon it. We had a short week due to good friday. We took our 1-9 ITE practical/exam and I got 100% on both. Feels good. Its just brute memorization. Womack and a few of them aren't doing so hot on the concepts and he was suffering through the loss of a close friend. It's difficult to help when you don't know what to do. It really affected my mood for this long weekend. It's now easter sunday and this afternoon I'm going with Chav to get some boba and vietnamese food. I hope it's good. My allergies have cleared up entirely, I think the air filter really worked. The omelette this morning from the omelette master was simply exquisite. I've just been chilling in my room this weekend and playing Tokyo Mirage. Gw2, watching Rainbow, and reading. I didn't workout too much this past week and I'm going to change that this week. One thing I read in Meditations that I really liked was that humans were created to help on another just like teeth work together to chew food or fingers work together to type. It is within our nature. In Why we sleep I reread how REM sleep is so fundamental in developing babies/fetuses and that alcohol disrupts this which can lead to underdevelopment in the neural circuitry of our brains leading to emotional, social, and mental problems later on. I've been sleeping later and later recently and that's another thing I want to change. So this week I'm going to focus on three things. Physical, social, and sleep health.

This week has been really great. I walked to Saigon Oriental market with Chav to get some Pho, it was pretty good. We got to explore the lovely ghettoes of Warrington. We continued ITE Monday. I've been getting back into my workout routine. We met new baby class yesterday. They are tall and okay I guess, haven't got to know them really. They got a cute blonde girl who wears a shit ton of makeup. Cory Love I guess. Womack also got dropped to junior class today. Sucks since he's dealing with a lot of issues. I'm getting a lot more comfortable with everybody and trying to be more social. I also finished Rainbow. It was very good. I loved how each character except Soldier got some character development and how everything worked out in the end. Very wholesome. I'm also nearly done with my legendary amulet that I've been working on in gw2 since 2+ years. All those story, gathering, jps, metas, drms, events, and bosses. It's very fulfilling looking back on my journey for Returning Champion.

It's a Sunday and the Internet in the Ghettos is down. The rest of the week went by pretty quickly. We had another mock prt friday morning and I managed to get a triple excellent. I felt pretty good about that. I've been trying to improve my running more in terms of distance and form. I'm trying to run more like Kipchoge and break in my shoes. I've also been working on the muscle up, them shits hard. I've started watching Ping Pong the animation and it's pretty hype. The mc is such a m2k. We're graduating in two weeks and our 10-14 test is next week. Time flies. I've been mostly reading Gone with the Wind. It's very detailed and gives a unique look into southern living in the 1800s. I can see how it influenced the south today and making these comparisons is quite interesting. I'm also still playing tokyo mirage sessions and I'm really enjoying the characters and style. The slice of life aspect of tokyo was something that was missing in P5 that is represented very well in this series. I'm going to continue to work on my physical, social, and sleep health.

Nearing the finish line for A school. We finished the ITE course and practical last week. My back has been killing me but it has gotten better. I was in all sorts of pain last week but also improved and streamlined a lot of my exercise routines. Yesterday we went to sushi masa and I ate a good amount of a little bit of everything. I've been writing a little exerpt from Meditations in the mornings so I can read and reflect upon it in the compound. In gw2 I finally finished the legendary amulet achievement which I started in june last year. It has been one of the longest endeavors but good memories. Gone with the wind has gotten a lot more interesting. I've finished part 1 and damn it took a dark turn for Scarlett O'Hara.

Another easy day tomorrow and then PRT on monday/graduation. Triple E baby. In addition to my health focus, I'd like to appreciate what I have more. Storms befall everyone; but not everyone can stand firm against them. It is my good fortune to bare whatever happens nobly.

A lovely saturday in the beautiful pensacola florida. I'm feeling pretty good, productive and stress-free. I was listening to the TF podcast with Lebron James and his personal fitness coach yesterday and their insights on optimal performance and recovery was so simple and intuitive. Stuff I already knew but didn't really consider following. Topics like consistent training, rehabbing the body, clean eating, thinking about longevity. I've noted some keep points about how lack of sleep can influence physical performance from Why We Sleep: <br> -Time to physical exhaustion decreases to 10-30%.<br> -Aerobic output is reduced <br> -lower limb extension force <br> -lower vertical jump height/explosive power/small twitch fiber <br> -decreased peak and sustained muscle strength/long hold muscles <br> -lower cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory capabilities<br> -faster lactic acid buildup rate <br> -reduced blood oxygen saturation/increased blood carbon dioxide<br> -lower sweat output/lower body temperature cooling efficiency<br> -increased chance of injury <br> <br> They talk about making sure the room is cool, dark, comfortable, electronic light free. One part of the interview I was amazed by was LBJ's memory recall of exactly everything he ate the day before: <blockquote> LeBron James: Hold on. Let me think about it. Yesterday, I had an egg white omelet with smoked salmon and gluten-free pancakes with berries. That was my breakfast. For lunch, I had whole wheat pasta, salmon, and vegetables. And right before the game, I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And at halftime, I had sliced apples with almond butter on top. Right after the game, Mike gave me a protein shake to put in my system right after. I downed that right after the game last night. And then for dinner, I had chicken parm with a rocket salad and a beautiful glass of cabernet. </blockquote> It sounds all too simple and clean. He also mentions staying away from artificial drinks, sugars, and fried foods. One interesting part was when they talked about protein for recovery and avoiding heavy whey protein in favor of a cleaner plant based protein powder with almond milk or fruits. Just staying away from animal products in general. The whole short interview is worth reviewing and relistening in the future. After that I did some strength workout and went to chow and ran into the ctm homies. I've been feeling particularly productive and joyous since. This morning I went on a run around the loop and felt really good and ready for the PRT. Got chow for breakfast and managed to find lovely ceramic koi fish for mother's day and dad's birthday. Today was a good day.

Yesterday was a busy morning. We woke up before 4 for the official physical readiness test. I almost go all outstanding but I still killed it. We then chilled before going to get our graduation certificates. Eating chow in the mornings without rushing is so pleasant. We got the certs from chief and went to take pictures in front of 502. I pretty much chilled the rest of the day. Talked with mom and family about life. I also revamped and simplified my journaling site a little bit. I still can't believe it's been six years since I've created this site. Still going strong. I started an anime about Rakugo too. I didn't even know this was a thing. Very interesting.

This afternoon Anderson, Chav, Tomas and I went to Cub's Crawfish for some crawfish and fixings. It was so good. Right next to Hip Pocket too. We're a little spoiled with hole in the wall eateries. We talked about some out of pocket shit, it's always a good time. Surprisingly I had a great time chilling in holding muster in the heat too. Talked with a prospecting ctn about life and war. It was great. <blockquote>"People don't find me a witty conversationalist," you mope. So what? Focus on improving your character, not worrying how others perceive you. It's completely in your power to develop greater sincerity, generosity, persistence, strength, and contentment in all circumstances.<br> If your speaking skills need work, by all means work on them.

Yesterday I had watch. It was super chill, duty spotter. Nothing much notable except pulling over to sit in attention. We went to waffle house for lunch, so much food. Mustered this morning and ate breakfast. Not much else. I'm in part three of Gone with the Wind. The war is reaching the end. The south is getting licked. Scarlett finds out Ashley is imprisoned. Life is painful and suffering in the south due to the shortages and blockade and lack of manufacturing and ability to sell cotton. I watched a calisthenics video on youtube that got me hyped to learn the handstand pushup since you can transition from the straddle planche to and from it. It looks so cool and graceful when done correctly. I gotta build up my top strength especially in the shoulders. Now that the prt is done with I'm gonna focus on my running, planches, muscle ups, and handstands. These are my physical goals. Socially/emotionally I have a lot of work but I'm going to strike up conversations more to practice. Whatever pops into my mind. Sleep I'm doing okay but when I get really excited I wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble falling back asleep. I notice if this happens I can read my kindle until my eyes get tired and it helps me fall back asleep. <blockquote>Don't be discouraged if you fail to live up to your principles all the time.

Monday. The weekend was pretty chill. I played some yakuza kiwami. The gameplay is so janky but the storytelling and environment is awesome. We got badged up today. Top secret with SCI clearance baby. I've been inspired to learn how to do the handstand again. I remember trying to do it before but was put off by the petechia that would appear on my face afterwards. It's still happens, I'll try harder to maintain my breathing and relax my face/head when I do them. After muster today I watched a video from the witcher subreddit of a girl who made a diorama with lights and fog. I instantly fell in love with the craftsmanship and arts. She's incredibly multitalented. She does 3D modeling/sculpting, painting, woodworking, clay, miniature terrain, electronics, editing/cinematography, etc. Friggin insane.

The heat is exhausting. Reading a bunch of Gone with the wind. The yankees have beat the confederates back to atlanta and the whole town is in chaos. The army is retreating and Melanie has her child. That afternoon scene in aunt pitty's house is so horrific. It really makes me appreciate modern birthing and modern life in general. <blockquote>In every activity, ask whether your soul is engaged.

It been quite humid. I was hard to run yesterday in the moist heat. The sweat would just build on the skin and it wouldn't evaporate or cool the body. I'm reading about the part when Scarlett gets to Tara and finds out her mother has died. She goes into a demonic state of mind to keep herself sane and to keep the thoughts at bay. It really highlights the tragedy of war and the aftermath it brings to the common folk. It's very insightful reading about this time period in such detail and brilliant description. I'm really enjoying Gone With The Wind. <blockquote>I am composed of matter and energy, which can't be destroyed—only transformed.<br>The elements that form me didn't appear out of nothing—they were transmutted from other things. And when I die, they will transmute into new combinations. Every part of me will become part of something else, and so on, forever.</blockquote>

Friday. It's quite cool today. So apparently I got kicked from the CRIMP course I was suppose to begin yesterday. It would've been nice to be told before hand but whatever. I got stressed about it and relapsed. So now I get another month of holding while everyone else classed up. I have a lot more time to draw and practice blender now. Its a blessing in disguise. I'm also starting CCNA prep for CRIMP so it will be fresh when I start. I got to make some new friends in holding because my mental will falter in this pit of loneliness. That will be my first objective in holding. Still reading Gone With the Wind, things are getting better for our dear Scarlett; it shows how surviving the worst makes the bad things seem trivial. It makes me think back into the time of bootcamp and how things could be a lot worse. Enough food, a warm bed, and a hunger for wisdom is really all I can ask for. <blockquote>Your character is simply the sum of your thoughts over time. The soul is dyed by thoughts. Immerse your soul, then, in thoughts like these: <br> Wherever you live, you can live well. Even if you must live in a palace, you can still live according to your principles. <br> Humans are social beings.

Sunday. Yesterday I had watch as shuttle driver. I drove around for five hours before being told that we were just secondary duty drivers on weekends. The CCNA course has been going fine. I learned today that my class up date might be all the way in July. If that's the case then I might as well take leave for July 4th. In gone with the wind the return of Ashley has blessed Tara and life goes on. The worse part of war is the aftermath and reconstruction of the defeated. The tax on Tara is forcing Scarlett to find ways of making money. It's strange reading about how Ashley is a shell of himself after prison and how he copes with reality by explaining how he was always a shadow before the realities of war and the dreamlike state he lived in. To me it seems foolish yet understandable at the same time. I'm approaching 28 and I want to finish my twenties out strong. Stay tuned.

Some ctms are returning from antenna maintenance, looking forward to seeing them again. More sleep is required. Get this smell off me. <blockquote>In the stream of life, nothing stands still. How quickly things arise, pass by, and disappear.<br> How foolish it is, then, to puff yourself up with pride or berate yourself with worry. Think of the boundless abyss of the past behind you and the infinite future stretching out ahead. From this perspective, how small are your achievements—and how petty your troubles.<br> Instead of boasting or moaning, rest content knowing that you are a small part of the universe, and treasure the moment of eternity that you have been given.</blockquote>

Another week another wait. My roomate moved out on thursday and I've had the room to myself ever since. On friday we went to BJ's Brewhouse for dinner. Me Amaya, Chav, Prinzi, Mcvay, Byrd. It was a good time and the food was great. I was doing so well but relapsed. Got back on and was thoroughly productive this past weekend. I created a holding schedule that I'll try to follow to increase productivity and creativity and minimizing baseless pleasures. I also cleaned basically everything in my barracks room. Feels nice to walk into a clean room. I also decided to go on leave in july motivated by the platinum amex card and visiting family and friends. It'll be short but sweet. I've also read a ton of Gone with the Wind. I'm pretty much at the end and so much has happened. Rhett and Scarlett gets married, they prosper throughout reconstruction. Fights and tragedies occur. They have a daughter. Beautiful Bonnie Blue. Rhett does a 180 and deeply cares for Bonnie. This one account of Rhett convinced me of having children one day. It describes the way one feels having a child that many people cannot describe but feel. Unfortunately Bonnie dies in an accident and revelations occur. Scarlett realizes she has no one but money and Melanie. Rhett is torn and broken from Scarlett's neglect and Bonnie's death. Ashley and Scarlett fall apart and Melanie dies from childbirth. Truly tragic. <blockquote> In making decisions, rely on reason and refuse to be swayed by bodily sensations of pain or pleasure.<br> This isn't to say that you should repress your feelings.

I've finished Gone with the Wind. 5/5. I really enjoyed the book, the characters and story the detail everything. The narration and perspective of the main character and the flow of the novel was incredible. Yesterday I had balls to six watch and man I haven't been that tired since n95 watch / overnight at the airport. Yesterday was so tiring it felt like a dream, I stayed up until 1900. Very depressive.

Saturday of a chill weekend. The weather has been up and down lately as with my mental fortitude. I get days of good motivated maniac happinesss and then depressive fear driven anxious days. I should be getting pinned for e4 next week and I'm trying to get my leave processed to visit in July. I started To Kill a Mockingbird, haven't gotten very far.

Wednesday of a lovely strange and eventful week. So when taking leave I found out that my class up is this month and tried to get student management to get me in the next CRIMP class. They followed up and it turns out I'm in the july INC-F class. The whole situation was a classic bureaucratic nightmare. At least I will very likely be able to go home in july. Yesterday I had shuttle driver watch and it was really good. Met a fellow sailor who was really chill and played bdo. It was a busy but enjoyable watch. Today I found out I was ranking up and getting pinned so I had to rush around getting pins and my haircut. We finally got pinned during afternoon muster and it was great. We shook hands with chiefs and had a little ceremony. I'm going to be taking more responsibility now as a petty officer. I also found out I have a secret admirer too. It's really strange. <blockquote> Soon you will be only ashes and a name—and a name is but a sound, an echo. The things people most value and pursue in this life are all passing away.

Saturday. I've had a good couple of days. Been on the grind and feeling good. I've been talking with Rachel and got her to play gw2. Yesterday we had ctm family dinner at Brother's BBQ and had some good smoked southern bbq. This weekend is a three day weekend because of Juneteenth. I've been also watching Jake in korea. I've got duty this weekend but no watch so that's good. I'm still in the process of getting my leave done but it's a process. The weather has been horrendously humid. The weather isn't even crazy hot but the evaporation just makes it so you sweat so much but the water just forms into droplets on my skin. The mosquitoes are also coming out so training outside hasn't been fun. I'm feeling really anxious recently about Rachel. I've never had someone actively express interest in me and she seems like a beautiful mind. She put herself out there and I'm not sure how to respond, almost ghosting in a way. Thinking too much about how I'll mess it up and what not. Indecision paralysis. I'm going to practice being more forward and blunt. Just like Rhett Butler.

Tuesday. Back to normal. The weekend was pretty uneventful yet not. I just chatted with Rach a bunch through discord and it was magical. Idk we just click. She's so amazing. I learned about her past, hobbies, favorites, and life in general. We're very similar. I don't know if fate or destiny or true love is the word but it's crazy how things just work out. She was born and raised in Okinawa and move to Florida when she was 15. So damn cute and a god gamer. I'm just lovestruck. I also got my leave processed this morning and booked my flight for July 8th. I watched Everything, Everywhere, all at once too. It was pretty good. The warriors won this year.

Thursday. Staying on the grind. Today we had a shakeup with n92. We're now doing one morning muster, a working party muster after work, then a potential 1300 muster. Overall pretty good. Yesterday we chilled in the heat at the pool and watched Prinzi and n71 compete. Rachel rachel rachel... We dueled in guild wars 2 yesterday and I was so enthralling even though I felt like a complete bully. She was into it which was really endearing to be honest. I started Violet Evergarden and it's really good. Kind of clicks more with me now I'm in the military. I'm really on top of my game at the moment.

I was looking forward to the modified n92 schedule but apparently we weren't going to do that. So we fucked around after muster in working parties. There was a bunch of drama in n92 with the leads, and leadership, and new graduates. Kind of a shitshow. On the way to second muster I signed the watchbill and talked with Womack about his situation. He's getting sep for medical reasons. I chatted with Alban and he was also getting sepped for similar reasons. Shit just sucks. We had to muster in the sun for a good minute and then I went to chow. It was mid. Then I heard about a n71 picnic and went there with Byrd and Chav, saw a lot of the old ctms and a lot of the new ones and some of the instructors. Lots of pizza and soda. Chatted for a bit with Chav and then went back and had a lovely conversation with Rachel. I decided to go to chow for dinner and met byrd, mcvay, and amaya there and we just shat the shit and laughed our asses off. It was a good day. We all have assholes.

It was an okay weekend. All I could think about was Rachel but I didn't want to seem obsessive so I kept distant. Saturday was painful not doing much but staying in my barracks. Yesterday I had watch so that kept my mind busy. It was pretty chill, duty spotter with Pineda. We did odd runs and shit. When I got back Rachel discorded me and we just talked about our vulnerabilities and weaknesses and her past relationships. It was very emotional. At night, our duty section was called up to the mailroom to clean because a person sprayed it with a fire extinguisher. Idiot. This morning I found out I classed up for antenna maintenance just as Rachel was put into n92. What the hell. I got to meet the old a school ctms, a fleet returnee, and chief evans and that senior chief. I'm not that sad but damn right when I was going to meet Rachel. I started reading a book about a therapist getting therapy, it's very entertaining and I'm 3/4th done with to kill a Mockingbird. It's okay. I also finished Violet Evergarden. Very good.

Antenna maintenance has been more of the same from A school, just a good refresher with more antennas to memorize. We did a couple of labs regarding the tools and how to make a few cables. I enjoy the hands on of the course. The other three classmates are really chill and cool too. I've eaten with Chav a bunch right before he's flying out on leave today. I'm gonna miss him during this four day weekend. I don't has any plans but I'd like to meet Rachel finally. We've been distant lately. I don't know what's going on but I'm going a bit crazy thinking about her. What would Rhett do am I right? I'm thinking of starting small like a hangout or something because she keeps giving me excuses when I ask to eat out. Maybe I'll hang with Byrd or Prinzi or Mozon..

It's just outside Mobile and it was cool being inside the battleship and exploring the spaces and seeing all the naval history. We went to downtown Mobile after and ate and explored a bit. It was cool and way better than I expected of a downtown. Afterwards we went to Bucees super gas station. Not sure how I feel about that place with so much people. At night we drove towards Dustin just chilling and listening to music. I was DJ for a good bit and they seemed to enjoy it. Rachel has been busy this weekend but she saw me at the galley this morning and still seems interested so my ego is still intact. lol. I just finished To Kill a Mockingbird. It was ok but didn't really impress me. I enjoyed the perspective it was written in. Today is my rest day and I'm sort of just chilling.

Tuesday. This weekend was ok. It started out good but the past two days I just stayed in my room playing videogames and reading and exercising. My right leg is strained and my ankles hurt so I'm going to rest them this week. I'm not sure if it's my regime or my shoes or something more. I guess my plot armor wore off. Rachel has been distant and/or ghosting me and I can't stop thinking about her. Besides a quick chat on saturday there's just radio silence. I'm having thoughts of all kinds and it's really affecting my mood and maybe my mindset in other things. I'm not sure what to do since we have these great conversations by discord and then she rejects any attempt to connect irl. I feel led on but I'd like to believe I'm not. I've been reading a book on therapy and its given me some insight on relationships but I'm having trouble applying them. I don't know if she's actually really busy or there's something else going on. A week ago she pours out everything and says I'm amazing then stops. I'm left thinking what I did wrong. I'm just going to lay the ball in her court and focus on passing antenna maintenance this week and recovering and my leave I'm taking on friday. Ant main has been great. A lot of it is hands on and I really like it. We learned to weatherize cables today.

Thursday. Another pretty chill week. Tomorrow is going to be a busy day. We have our antenna maintenance final practical and knowledge test. We did a study session and pt session this morning. I'm feeling ready. So for the practical we have to do start with a visual inspection of the antenna to check for any damage, chipped paint, or weather related. Next we run a time domain reflector test to check the length of the cable/antenna. The big on with this is to change the velocity of propagation based on the cable. Next we do a multimeter resistance test on the connections for the appropriate resistances. The third test is the network analyzer, field fox. This one runs power through the antenna to test the frequency ranges and peaks using voltage standing wave ratio. After the pre install tests we sand the mounting area and apply zinc anti seize there and to the screws. We hand screw three in a triangle and then the other partner can let go and we do the rest. We tighten we at least 18 lbs of ft pressure and then install the cables. We clean the install area with acetone and put some silicone dielectric then screw the cable on. Clockwise linerless rubber tape at least four inches then counterclockwise electrical tape at least two inches on to that. That pretty much ends the practical. After I pass my finals tomorrow I'm going to need to go back and pack for my 7pm flight. I'll also need to cut my hair and go to the quarterdeck around 1600 to checkout. I want to get lunch to. So ideally get out around 11 get lunch>cut hair>pack>nwus/checkout>chill/uber around 1730. Au voir.

Couple of busy days. On Friday I crushed the final and had a great day. Nice workout in the morning and then good chow with Tomas and Prinzi. The final practical was good, me and Monzon killed it for the most part. The knowledge test I missed three out of fifty, it was a good time. For lunch I chatted with Simons and reflected on the past couple of months. I checked out and Monzon drove me to the airport. The flight went well and I got to cali around 1130. We got innout and I knocked out. Yesterday we shopped at target for Kelly's present and got a hilarious birthday card of Jojo Seewa and then we went to party. It was kind of overstimulating seeing all the cousins and drinking with them. After I chilled at home. Man my room got dusty and there was a smell of being non-aerated. After we went to Shabuya to get all you can eat hotpot. It was good definitely hit the hotpot craving I've been having. I caught up with Derek who has graduated by now, that's crazy. He's still at Menya and doing his cooking thing. I'm glad for that. We got boba after at Xing Fu Tang. It's probably the closest to a ten boba tea I've had. Mmm. After we went to Kelly's again for an afterparty thing. I had a deep conversation with other cousin Vincent's dad and brother. Kind of unexpected but it's cool seeing military family members looking after each other. Apparently Vincent is an arm pilot now touring in South Korea right now. Wow. It was touching seeing his father convey his worry and trust upon me. It was a heartfelt talk. Man I had a lot of one on ones yesterday with family. I was drained but it was good. This morning I ran 5.5 miles around the area and it felt really good. In about three hours I'm going to have lunch with Jeff and Chau. Oh and Rachel dm me late last night. She was lonely. I'm still unsure of her motives but I do miss her.

Yesterday I just ate pho ga kho and flew back. Reading maybe you should see a therapist made me tear up during the flight. Today I picked up my certificate and caught up with the ctm fam.

First day of class was great yesterday. It was rainy but not too bad after the morning. Getting chow has been good since I can go when the gang is there now. The first day was fun, it was just me Tomas and Mozon so class was definitely interesting. We learned the gist of what the Inc-F system is and where things were. I think it's going to be fun. I do miss chief evans and senior rayburn though. We have civilian instructors/retired military which isn't too bad. I'm still trying to decide how to schedule my time around the bravo shift shenanigans. I'm feeling a lot more present now and super I don't want to say horny but more aware of attractive people. Also my energy levels is steady and I smile a lot more. This therapy book is really enjoyable and cathartic to read. I'm about 80% done and loving it. Maybe I should talk to someone. I also finished the first season of March comes in like a lion. It was good. I really enjoyed the characters and how simple the art style is yet powerful the relationships they develop. Currently I'm starting to study for the e-5 exam in september. lol crazy. not even a year in the navy and I'm progressing towards e5 already.

Friday. Yesterday was tiring. I think a combination of jetlag and bravo shift schedule got to me. I was out of it during class and we covered a lot about the system. CTM as basically TS system admins and electricians. That was something I wasn't expecting to be honest. The troubleshooting is so complex and there's so much to learn it's overwhelming. One step at a time I suppose. It's also hard to review after class since we can't bring any of the material outside the compound so I'll really have to make the most of my time in the compound. I think it'll be alright as I am adjusting to this new schedule. I've got it planned out for the most part. Basically chill and exercise until class while studying the e5 bibs a bit. This full focus in class then crash the moment I get back. I'm also skipping breakfast for sleep because waking up for that is not worth it. Class yesterday was good we got to connect with our instructors a lot more, we talked about family, food, movies, videogames, anime. It was awesome.

Wednesday. Dear child. I'm going to start addressing these journals to my future child influenced by Violet Evergarden episode 10. Yesterday I was a little on edge about INC-F and the constant change of instructors but I felt a lot better after doing test points and getting familiar with the system. It shows that taking that first step outside your head and into action leads to better thoughts and feelings. Just like my workout this morning I was overthinking what I should do to get stronger and the weather outside and what ifs. But once I started the routine and habit, everything felt automated and good. Jumping into that flow of time and is just good. Sure it sucked but after I was genuinely smiling from the endorphins. The same can be applied in all aspects of life. Struggle amplifies good results. Getting started with the struggle is the hardest part. I look forward to my studies and struggles ahead. I was in the galley this morning for lunch with Prinzi and Raymond chatting a little and Raymond was going on about his issues with heart rate and sleep. I wished I got deeper into the conversation but I sort of just listened and tried to read my kindle instead. I regret not talking more and it's something I need to improve on. Being first or at least being more present and active in social aspects. I've improved a lot since last year and the military has given such a great community and family that I really appreciate. I have so many friends and associations, ctm fam, familiar faces, great mentors, bootcamp shipmates. I take them for granted and really should be more active with them. I can't let life pass by while I stagnate again. Life moves on and it becomes unbearable when one becomes a burden on oneself and others. Always keep moving while remaining present. Thinking about you from the past, Dad.

Saturday. It has been a stressful couple of days. We started troubleshooting the inc-f system and the first day was rough. I was stumbling around and getting overwhelmed by the system. We did a whole day of practice on thursday and then a mock problem. I learned a lot and got more familiar with reading the diagrams and how to diagnose and test the problems. It's just power and timing. The graded troubleshooting was yesterday and I was still a little shaky but much better the first two problems. The last problem I made a grave mistake and decided that a test point was fine without actually testing the connection to save time for some poorly thought-out reason. I ended up failing that problem and I'm going to have to retake another one on Monday. Live and learn. Because of that I got to get more time and practice with the system though. I know I've got it now. The one thing I'm shaky on is the actual physical troubleshooting finding the test points shouldn't be so difficult but I choke and miss it. Relaxing and breathing will help me, it's not something I haven't done before. Understand the problem, use the diagnostic tools to find the problem, map out a path of probable cause, troubleshoot/test the faults, implement the solution. It's not hard. Struggles like these in a schooling environment is super helpful in one's growth. It reminds me of bootcamp when I was struggling with watches and confrontation, in A-school where I discovered gaps in my knowledge and understanding. Now I'm facing a mental problem with dealing with new things similar struggles that will be overcome. We learn and grow the most from failures.

I did manage to go to McGuire's Irish pub for steak and it was so good. The ambience was so comfy and I felt right at home. Everything was delicious. On monday I ended up choking and failing the redo and had to do a academic review board yesterday. I had to sit in front of the board and explain my situation and really focus on why I couldn't perform simple troubleshooting. They gave me another chance and I managed to complete the problem easily. All the instructors were very helpful and empathetic to my situation. Seeing them interact so casually and joke around made me feel like I was part of the family. With the weight off my shoulders life was just better. We did more networking and talked about foreign travel with Mrs. Brenstenner and the vibe was just happy. I got to put in more effort and relax and get comfortable. It's something I've had trouble with throughout my life but you can't be afraid of failure. Failure sucks but I feel like I've learned more about the system than I would've if I just barely passed by. Don't look to fail but also don't worry about it so much that it causes failure. Skirt that fine line child.

Friday night. It's been a chill couple of days. On Wednesday we managed to take the system down so thursday was a non training day. I've been studying up on networking and it isn't so bad, just a lot of ways to troubleshoot the same symptoms/problems. I've been feeling spaced out recently. I think it has to do with bravo and just being up right before bed. We did go through a bunch of self-made troubleshooting problems today. It was good practice and I learned a lot. On top of that I've been playing Alpha Sapphire and watching March comes in like a Lion S2. Hope the weekend gets better.

Good couple of days. Our internet went down for like five days so it was a stressful couple of days. On saturday me and Chav went to Blue Dot to try and get some burgers but it was closed so we went to the Five Sisters Cafe for good southern food. I started reading East of Eden by John Steinbeck. It's good, very descriptive and vivid. The story is kind of everywhere at the moment but the characters are very interesting. The way Steinbeck uses metaphors is master class. We did more troubleshooting practice on Monday and graded yesterday. We all passed and now we move on. So the internet was fixed this morning and I checked my orders and saw that I will be going to Virginia Beach for a month for surface combat systems training at NAS Oceana. Then I'll probably be going to my ship located at sunny San Diego, California. DDG-111 Spruance. I'm so fucking excited. Emotions are so fickle and changes from highs to lows. A day ago I was stressed the fuck out now I'm happy as can be. My meditation practices over the years have really helped me ground my emotions and feel them without letting them overwhelm me. Tips for a racing mind and body pumped with stress/depressive hormones is to name the emotion and how it makes you feel. Feel it and think about the way it makes your heart beat, how your body reacts and let it pass then return to a constant like your breath. This is how you ground yourself and return to the present to do what you are meant to do. We got nicknames yesterday, Mozon is Trouble, Dickey is Backseat, Tomas is What If?, and I'm Quiet One. Haha.

Yesterday we started RFD and it was a lot of information. We bought some MREs at the commissary. During dinner chow we listened to an erotica about a guy having intercourse with a peach. Very random and hilarious. The MRE was delicious and somewhat filling. Life is good. There's some compound cats and kittens that we've been playing and feeding. They are so cute. I need to do a drawing of them sometime. UwU. Pet a cat when you see one. Lunchtime. Don't be afraid to say hi.

Saturday. Life is pretty swell at the moment. Aced the quiz yesterday and did our test points for RFD. I'm a quarter way through East of Eden. The characters are meeting up just like in The Stand. Thinking of which I need to read more. I have been thinking about my time left in Pensacola. Leaving in October and it feels like I should make the most of my time left. Just like Julie. Later we're gonna go to blue dot or ruby slipper.

The weekend was alright. The internet went down again but came back up eventually. I watched some porn again and it didn't do much for me. A huge waste of time and energy. We ended up going to Another Broken Egg and it was the first time I got an eggs benedict and it was delicious. I also got a belgian cookie dough waffle and it was so fluffy and exquisite. I'm getting a bit anxious about the future as my time here is narrowing. Thinking about the move, passing Inc-f, e5 exam, buying a car, the rest of my time here, the internet issues, girl problems, what I want in the future. These internal thoughts are harrowing me and keeping me from living in the moment. One thing at a time. Now let's just focus on lunch and class. Relax and enjoy now. I've started season 6 of peaky blinders and Tommy has stopped drinking alcohol and his character development is so good for it. The shogi anime is good too, it's on the arc about bullying in school and how teachers can't really do much about it. In East of Eden, Adam Trask has married Cathy and they move to California. The narrator's mother, Olive has become a teacher and more backstory is given. In The Stand, Mother Abigail meets the deaf mute's party and the other two parties are converging to Nebraska too. It's getting spicy.

Yesterday was such a good day. The vibes were just perfectly balanced. Stressful yet enjoyable. Riding that fine line between bad and good. We had graded troubleshooting and it didn't feel difficult yet the problems were different. We all passed and I had some very fun interactions with Tomas. We bonded over books and everyone seemed happy. I draw the class on the whiteboard and I just felt good, like when you're at the time and place you're suppose to be, doing what you're suppose to do. WidePeepoHappy. It was very pleasant and all the instructors are so awesome. I'm grateful for the opportunity and glad to have Inc-f as my C-school. Getting teachers this awesome and interacting with them in such close interactions is better than any public school method. Note to self: expose my children to as many arts, sciences, and cultures as possible. That way they can find their path in life. I picked this up from Tim's interview with Neil Degrasse Tyson who mentioned his parents exposing them to sometime new every week in New York.

Sunday. Sleep is very important. That previous Thursday, I was super happy and excited the previous night that when I awoken from a nightmare I could not fall back asleep. Learning in class was tough and I was out of it by the end of the night. I slept a good amount the following night and Friday was grand. We did graded troubleshooting and it went smoothly and I was aware of the present. I notice that I'm eager and willing to socialize more when I'm well rested. The boys got together and went to McGuire's for dinner and damn we ate a healthy portion. It was such a good time. Anderson, Oki, Byrd, Amaya, Ramos, and Chav went. We got a nice quieter table in the back of McGuire's and I had the ribeye, it was fucking delicious. Yesterday me and Chav went to check if the Blue Dot was open to get burger. It was not. We decided to checkout Khon's on Palafox and it was disappointing. That seemed to be the theme of yesterday. We went to Bubba's sweet shop down the street and got ice cream and sweets. It was good but it melted too fast as we were trying to catch the bus so I had to eat it so fast that I couldn't enjoy it. We ended up missing the bus and went to a bar that had "strawberry boba" that was alcoholic so we just got duck buns. It was okay but awkward and funny. The bus took about an hour to get back to Corry and we didn't know we had to pay a dollar. Overall very disappointing, awkward, and interesting day. Life is Strange.

Wednesday. A busy couple of days learning about the system. Going through the motions and enjoying the moments as they come. I finished the shogi anime March comes in like a lion. It was enjoyable. It kind of ends in a cliffhanger but it really expresses the city/urban life of outer tokyo and the lifestyles of the people living there very well. Super good slice of life. Choose your legend whatever number is here. Not as exciting as last years but it's a thing I'm excited for. Also gw2 is releasing on Steam finally. We're gonna see an influx of new players thankfully. Still daily grinding soo won meta even though I have enough for a gen 4 legendary weapon. Still working on my wvw legendary armor. What sucks is that the moral of some of my classmates has been low. It kind of sucks to hear them say they aren't having a good time and dealing with problems or ready to leave or wouldn't mind getting seped. That's just life. We go through hard times, we find out something isn't our path, we change, and we will smile again. <blockquote>Kaladin said, "You told me it will get worse."<br><br> "It will," Wit said, "but then it will get better.

Friday. Yesterday was good. We had student input problems and the one I put in was really difficult apparently. It took the whole class period and I learned a lot from watching how the others troubleshot and got a lot more comfortable in the lab. Today is Oki's last full day here, he's graduating today and flying to Hawaii tomorrow. Bittersweet. We're planning on going to Sushi masa one last time tonight but we have graded troubleshooting for HF/ES so I hope we can make it. Today has been busy. I worked out after a rain shower and then preped for Soo Won meta while cutting my hair and doing my morning routine. Now there's some reprieve and a moment of peace. I'm going to relax a bit before going to volo to brush up on troubleshooting for tonight. I really hope we can leave early for sushi. Prayge. Sometime I heard in the TF podcast this morning that I really liked was when Peter Attia described how one of his beliefs that changed recently was that personality was not set in stone. He used to think that personality was like programmed into you and un changeable. Recently he has seen his anger become 50% less than before through thoughtful changes in his behavior and lifestyle. It's a mix of fate/occurrences/events, reaction/response/action to it, and mindset after that can influence personality and the emotions of people. Let's continue this good day. Love you.

Sunday. A very gloomy weekend. On friday we blew through our graded troubleshooting. I got most of it but I gotta remember to follow chils priority. We were late to family dinner but we still went to Kalbi Ichiban, the korean/japanese fusion place outside downtown. It was surprisingly good in terms of sushi. I got the chef's platter and the cuts were actually good quality. Yesterday I felt pretty lonely and binged. My weekend schedule got all fucked because I didn't feel like spending money and going out. I stayed up until 2am getting destroyed in wvw, good times... I did take the ctm e5 175 practice exam too and got 50%, not sure if that's good or not but it's better than what I've been getting on the quizzes. I'm going to aim for 75%.

<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
Start of the week. I just had some lunch and the lack of sleep caught up with me this morning. I slept in a bit and woke up with a minor migraine. Not worth losing sleep. I was thinking about purchasing a car this morning and did a bunch of browsing and ended up not going through with it. I ended up missing the time frame for calisthenics outside so I just did eight counts in my room. I did a no prep daily soo won and then went to lunch. I ate with Mcvay and Boyce and we were joined by Raymond and ctm2 Garcia. Mcvay is actually ending up going to inc-f and is currently in holding. She'll be fine. In east of eden, I've just finished part two and it's at the part when Adam has broken from his stupor after a year and a beating from Samuel. They talk about naming his sons. The book is well written but it's not as captivating to me. Maybe it will get better in part three. I'm going to try some advice I read on reddit about developing my social skills. It starts with pushing through that initial fear of socialization. Get past that barrier into a social situation and talk to people. As you do your social skills will improve naturally and you will be more comfortable and confident. That initial fear will decrease and the cycle repeats. As you talk to more people from different groups/events you'll develop relationships and expand your social network. It all feeds into itself. Think persona social links. So my goal is to have a conversation with someone random once a day and hold conversation with someone I've met already, preferably having a deep conversation with them. This is something I'm going to improve on. This is the path that led me to your mother.

Wednesday. Life has been good. I've been trying to socialize more and it's doing good. I'm about half way done with East of Eden and I've just read a very profound section involving Samuel, Adam, and Lee. It has been ten years since the naming of Adam's two boys and time has past. No much has changed but Samuel is going on vacation away from his farm and perhaps going to permanently leave. A sort of death of his old life and current one. He has been depress since the death of one of his girls. Adam, having broken out of his stupor ten years ago still passively lives as life passes. Lee takes care of the boys and seeks truth by studying and philosophizing with his ancient wise relatives. They learn Hebrew and Greek to study the bible verse discussed by the three men ten years ago about sin. There are three variations of the passage: "Do thou rule over sin." "Thou shalt rule over sin" and "Thou mayest rule over sin." One being an order, another being a promise, and the final being a choice. It's profound in that it leaves one with a choice. Time is short and I must depart. This is my choice.

Thursday. Relapsed this morning after binging because I didn't feel like running in the rain. It felt and continues to feel really bad. I don't feel focused and I'm a lot more timid. Also my motivation to interact with others low and I just feel awkward around people and in my own skin. I'm also more fidgety when I'm passive/idling. It's like a feeling of sleepiness and anxiousness and guilt all at once. I hate this feeling and never want to experience this crap again. I just came back from class for "lunch" and I was so quiet and in my shell all throughout. I need to break from this haze and get focused. What I need to think about is doing my best and catching my feeling, react appropriately and letting go of the negative ones. Move on to feelings of confidence, peace, and goodness.

Sunday morning. Last couple of days have been a rollercoaster. Friday we did more troubleshooting and we were let out early. I had trouble with the troubleshooting and was really disappointed with myself. We got chow and it was great. It really helped my mood. Having friends to fallback on can mean a lot when you're depressed. At night me, Amaya, and Byrd went to the cigar lounge downtown for cigars and drinks. It was a good time. I had a moscow mule and a dark and stormy. I got borderline drunk and we ate pizza. Yesterday morning we went to the Ruby Slipper for Tomas' birthday and it was fun. The food was amazing. American breakfast is something I'll miss from Pcola. Went back and relapsed again and went through the motions. I slept in the afternoon so I didn't feel sleepy and slept late. At three in the morning I was awaken when my new roommate moved in straight from bootcamp. It was good helping him get his bearings straight, I like helping juniors out.

Tuesday. Sunday was pretty fun. Me and Chav went to Cordova mall to get some Steak and Shake after failing to see the times for El Asador and Siam Thai being closed. We went to World Market after and then Mcdonalds to get happy meals for pokemon cards. It was hilarious. My new roomate has been cool. IT from Tennessee straight out of bootcamp. He has a lot of questions and I like answering them. Our practice troubleshooting problem yesterday went pretty bad. It was an older issue that somewhat related to v/uhf so we didn't really see it. It left us humbled and wanting to improve. A good lesson to not forget older sections and to really think of all the possibilities rather than hyper focus on one thing. I started a new anime, A Place Further than the Universe. It's a slice of life about a high school girl trying to live out her youth by doing something unthinkable and random, going to Antarctica. It's surprisingly good and funny. I look forward to adventure and the unknown after watching this. Prayge.

Yesterday was pretty good. We did two graded troubleshooting problems and we'll be doing two more today. We seem to know what we need to know but we overthink things and stress too much that it clouds our thinking and ends up messing us up for the most part. I've been talking a lot with Jackson, my fifth roommate. He's pretty cool, he tries a little too hard to be a grownup for his age I think and compares himself too much but I think it'll help him grow a lot. It's something I saw a lot in bootcamp. I just hope the negativity on this base from other people doesn't get to him. My triceps are shot and sore from Sunday still. I did an easy workout this morning and damn it burns. Something I haven't felt like in a long while. I'm gonna get chow soon and prep a bit by chilling for these problems later.

Thursday. Last day of the week since tomorrow is a no training day. We've got more practice problems today and yesterday's went quite well. I finished reading the Little Prince yesterday in class and it was kind of trippy. The writing itself isn't too amazing but the lessons it is trying to convey is significant. Basically it is trying to get people out of the mindset of mindlessly going through the motions to care about the most meaningless things like vainty, riches, and mundane work. The important things like relationships are what we should be present for and prioritize. A feel that was used as an example in the book was christmas time and how the events leading up to opening of the gift is more memorable than the gift itself. Tomorrow I'm going to try and knock out the long checklist of things I need to do: schedule a dental appointment, go to PSD to get my CAC card updated, and get my patches sewn on my dress uniforms. I'll try to remember the little princes' lesson with you little one.

On Friday we helped Tomas move out of Echo and back to Corry. We explored NAS a bit and tried to get errands done. After that we went to Blue Dot for burgers and some boba then the mall. Yesterday I chilled and did more car shopping/playing Cyberpunk 2077. It's a pretty good game, just very linear so far. We went to Tuscan Pizzeria for pizza for dinner then to the mall and books a million. I enjoyed it. Not sure what I'll do today other than exercise and get some laundry done. I really want to get my financing done and buy the car this week. My plan is to use it to drive to Virginia for my comsec class in october than take the free leave to go cross country to san diego after that. This adventure is inspired by the anime A Place Further than the Universe. I really want to visit all the national parks that are on the way and explore America while I can.

Unfortunately this morning the tire pressure light was on so I'm a bit stressed about that. On top of that I still have a bunch of errands and things to do. Car titles, registration, payments, tire checks. The advancement exam was early in the morning and it really fucked my brain up. Compound with insufficient sleep, I'm an anxious zombie atm. I'm gonna try and relax and focus on class for now. I've made an appointment with Pep Boys to service the car and I'll try and knock out the car stuff next week. I gotta say, Tomas is a real G. She's been so helpful and such a good friend. Driving me to Foley and everywhere else, I owe her big. Never thought I'd have such a good girl friend.

Unfortunately the Queen of England passed away yesterday at 96. It's a little crazy. The news heard throughout the world. It came up in every conversation. Humans are really social creatures. I'm enjoying cyberpunk 2077. The game is pretty good now that the game has been through several patches. We got to see photos from Mr Gray, Wood, and Messler yesterday.

Tomorrow I've got to get my car titled and registered and then do some more errands throughout the week. I'm having a blast playing cyberpunk, the city, movement, stories are really well done. I'm playing a knife throwing/monowire build and it is awesome. It makes me wonder about the future and how cybernetics will integrate with organics. One step at a time. I want to go out more now that I can drive so next weekend I hope to explore more of the area before leaving. It's going to be a busy next couple of weeks and I'm prepared. Be still love.

Rollercoaster once again. I was super productive tuesday and wednesday but kind of went downhill during class I want to blame lack of sleep but I did get a solid 6 hours or so because my roommate woke me up and I couldn't fall back asleep. Tuesday I made an optometry appointment and got my cac updated. We also passed our last unit for C school and I was very happy. I didn't do too well in class yesterday and I was missing a lot of things. We're going into final systems and the review of everything kind of messed me up. This morning I relapsed and didn't go for a run. A lot of negative emotions. I'm gonna 180 this shit. Lunch and volo and gonna kill these practice problems today. Tomorrow I got dental at 1000 and hopefully I'll get back on track. I'm almost done reading Trevor Noah's biography about his life in South Africa. It's really good and funny as hell. My favorite story is the once when he was doing his DJing career in the slums/city and he had a crew with a dancer named Hitler. They would make a semicircle around Hitler every time he would dance and yell "Go Hitler!" over and over. One time they were booked at a Bar Mitzvah at a Jewish school concert and ten minutes into the gig they brought out Hitler in front of the jewish crowd and did their thing. They got super offended and kicked Trevor out and he thought they were dissing his culture/race so it was a hilarious situation due to lack of understanding from both parties. Funniest story I've ever read.

Kind of back at the grind. Yesterday we did more practice and I was missing so much. I finished Born a Crime by Trevor Noah and it was so good. The key takeaway from Trevor's mom was that the now is the only thing that matters and the choices you make now is who you are. The story about how his step father shot his mom in the head and she survived was insane. A shot in the butt clean through and then four misfires where the bullet casing is ejected and then a crazy mad dash to the car where she gets shot in the head from behind barely missing her spine towards her eye, ricocheting off her left cheekbone and exiting clean without any major damage. Insanity. This morning I went to dental but they only did xrays and prep for my next visit in october. <blockquote>“Learn from your past and be better because of your past,” she would say, “but don’t cry about your past. Life is full of pain. Let the pain sharpen you, but don’t hold on to it. Don’t be bitter.”</blockquote>

The weekend was good and bad. Saturday I got some pho with Tomas and Chav. We went to Saigon Oriental market. I was feeling kind of overwhelmed by the amount of people there. I notice that I get super nerfed after pmo. It sucks and I know this yet I persist. Anyways we got lunch and then went back to base. I finished Cyberpunk and got the ending where you give up your consciousness to Arasaka and downloaded mods for my next playthrough. Saturday night we got dinner at Texas Roadhouse for Anderson's going away dinner. It was fun and cozy. We went to a sports good store after to get stuff and mess around. Yesterday I basically stayed in and sat on my ass. Didn't really feel good after relapsing. It's a problem. I feel unfocused afterwards and super anxious like my hearts trying to escape from my chest. On top of that I'm really tired like I can just lay in bed and fall asleep, super low energy. It's really bad. I also don't feel like socializing or looking at people in general after. I need to get over this down period and get back to god mode. This morning I went to optometry and got my sight checked. They are making me some glasses and it's going to take two to three weeks. I wonder if I'll still be here to receive them. Tomorrow morning I'm going to go down to the tax collector office again to see if my title has been transferred so I can register my car. Troubleshooting has been painful all last week and I can surmise why. My routine has been interrupted with errands and I've been unfocused and post relapse. This week my goal is simple: Kill the practice problems, register my car, and return to my routine. No more pmo, no more cyberpunk until after the finals. More reading for leisure, less computer time. I've been planning my roadtrip a bit too this morning. I want to get to godmode before I get out of this base. <blockquote>It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done better. 

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, who face is marred by dust, sweat, and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming. but who know the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause... 

Who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.

The calm before the storm. Yesterday went really good. I went to the tax collector to get my car registered and waited five hours in line to get processed. Everything went smoothly and I was able to get a military price for registering. For lunch I got Hip pocket deli. Love that cozy little sandwich lunch shop on Barrancas. Yesterday in practice troubleshooting I nailed everything and felt pretty good about it. I don't know what it was but I saw everything. Seems like philosophy, reason, and good thinking can really change ones fate. I'm currently reading The Kite Runner and it is really good. It's about two boys growing up in Afghanistan and the trials and tribulations that they face. The growing pains, loss of innocence, broken friendships, parental troubles, and the struggles of war and love and loss. A slice of life per se of Afghani culture and immigration to the U.S. in the 80s. It's very dark yet relatable and uplifting. Today we have actual hour and a half graded practice where we'll bring up the system. It'll be fun. I'm trying to calm my nerves and mind at the moment, my time slot is 1530.

The past couple of days have been good. On friday we did a few more final problems and we all did well. We got out early and I played a bunch of guild wars 2. Yesterday morning I crafted my wvw legendary armor finally and got the builds together. I then drove my roommate to the bank and got some lunch. I came back and relapsed... Habit is so hard to break. Pain. But anyways I decided to go to the seafood festival in Seville Park downtown with Chav and we got some food there. It's at the same place as the food truck festival but it was not as good this time. Too much cut and paste vendors and not much unique foods. I'm enjoying my NC a lot. I keep thinking about mods for it when I've barely even drove it. Once we pass our finals I'm gonna bring it to a dealer to service maintenance her before the drive to Virginia. Getting medical screening done has been a bitch.

Monday. Chill sunday yesterday. I've finished Grand Blue Dreaming. It was okay. Very funny but the story was just okay. I've started Bunny Drop and it's really good so far. It's about a 30 year old guy who's grandpa has died and he's left with a 5-6 year old aunt who was the grandpa's late child. It's very wholesome and makes me think about raising a child eventually. Right now I'm preoccupied with final systems and getting everything done for leaving this base. I'm planning on stopping by the tail of the dragon and driving it during my roadtrip next month. Six problems, three days. Lets get it.

Thursday. We've finished all final systems problems and we all passed. It feels really good. Today we're going to sushi masa for McVay's going away party. I'm excited. Hurricane Ian hit florida last night and made the weather extremely nice here. The humidity is tolerable and the temperature is so cool. The breeze is so pleasant too. I've finished reading The Kite Runner in the compound and it is also really good. It tells a story in Afghanistan about two half brothers growing up in Kabul and then the Russian invasion in the 80s then the Taliban takeover and the growing pains of that era. It's an incredible window into the life in the middle east, fiction but based on reality. The whole tale is just heartbreaking and epic. I notice that when I don't have distractions and a have a really good book, reading becomes so natural, like breathing. Tomorrow we're taking graduation pictures and next week I might be leaving Corry. Peace.

Saturday. I'm chilling this evening. Yesterday we went to the naval museum and took graduation photos and it was very awkward and cool at the same time. We kind of speedran it but it was awesome breaking off and doing my own thing. There's a piece of the moon in one of the hangars there. After that I went to TuDo vietnamese restaurant with my roommate to get some pho. At night I ran into Amaya, Byrd, and Jackson and went went to the german restaurant downtown to get some beers and food. It's the first time I got a schnitzel. That shit was so overpriced in my opinion. It was $50 for a schnitzel and beer. Scammed. We bonded over videogames and went home. This morning I got breakfast with Chav and then went to the local mazda dealership to get a pre-trip inspection but they were too busy and turned me away. I decided to drive to Fort Pickins and check out the area and beaches. The sand bar there is really nice and the weather was decent. Never really been to a beach like that and it wasn't crowded at all. I need to go back some time. It took me 9 months to finally go to the beach. It was fun but a lot of driving.

Wednesday. Inc F graduation this morning. There was a little ceremony in the classroom and we got our grad cert. The instructors gave a little speech and advice. We got our complaints passed up to senior chief and lieutenant. I got my medical appointment confirmed and I'm getting my orders modified to accommodate the delay in checkout. Everything works out in the end. So apparently I might be here longer in n94. On sunday me and chav went to taste of Jerusalem and ate middle eastern food. It was cozy and nice. Monday we did critiques which were pushed up the chain of command. Yesterday we just checked in and bullshitted. I love the ctm community. My amex blue card came in and I think my car cap came in. I might be driving to SD straight from here and get COMSEC scrubbed from my orders. I still want to drive up to North Carolina to drive the tail of the dragon so I think I'll take some extra leave to do so. More time in Corry I guess.

Sunday. So thursday was kind of crazy. We moved into n92 and did compound working party. It was busy doing new duties for the compound but fun. We added to the four already there. Two ctn drops, cti drop, and ctt. Weird folks but unique I guess. It was cool seeing all the ctm instructors too. On friday we had warrior day and I had dental so I went to that instead. I fixed one filling but got a cavity and another filling to fix. Annoying that they couldn't do it all in one day. I relapsed a bunch after feeling lonely and missing out on activities shit sucked. Yesterday I just felt reclusive and awkward and anxious. Such is post pmo. Today I've decided to drive to Perdido Key and check that place out. Maybe go to the beaches/national parks. I got to get used to driving and going around solo for my roadtrip. I think I'll get gas first and pack some Huel. I've started Edgerunners the cyberpunk anime and episode one is so good. Also started Run with the Wind, the running club anime. It's good as well. In worlds, group stages has started and NA is 0-6! poggers Kappa. This in the galley I was listening to two girls talk about astronomy and I was very interested and kind of turned on. I need to read more into the sciences. It's an area I'm sorely overlooking currently.

Tuesday. The weekend was kind of eh. I did go on a roadtrip to the scuffed stonehedge in Alabama and to Perdido Bay. I also found some sushi at Publixs. NA is getting fucked at worlds. We're 0-9 atm, a new record. I've also been watching twitchcon content. Today I went to compound 1 working party and did a bunch of escorts, it wasn't bad. I got called into student management about why I wasn't in Virginia today. I'm suppose to get that sorted Thursday after my screening and hopefully expedited. I've ordered a couple of things and I hope they get here before I'm suppose to leave. Some books, license plate cover, and a cyberpunk hat. The talks we have in the compound have been outrageous but I oddly enough enjoy them. There was an instance where they mentioned Claptrap's birthday party quest in BL2 and I laughed out loud. I've spent most of the day modding Cyberpunk yesterday. My V is pretty hot, I love the piano black hands. I also spoke I've a retired navy/army mechanic contractor while he was doing his boiler check in the compound. The guy was in his sixties and we have a wholesome interaction about military life and life in general. It was cool being able to connect with random people so easily through shared experience.

Thursday. One of those days. My day wasn't actually so bad until I slammed my miata into a parked car. It was so stupid. That's my biggest concern today. This is the first time I've caused an accident... So I was reverse parking in the lot behind the ghettos after running errands all day and I was driving in the NWUs so the black boots depressed both pedals as I was about to reverse and launched me into the parked car. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. So pissed at myself. Just ruined my day. Other than that I've just been in a mood. It rained this morning and I had to go to medical and got that cleared. I went to student management but Mr Johnson wasn't there. The accident happened during lunch as I was going back. The change in sleep schedule and n94 work and appointments is just a bit too stressful I think. I'm tired in the afternoon and kind of out of it. Being in the working party and having to interact with everyone is draining. Time to adapt. I've definitely overthinking this. I left a note. I'm willing to pay of the repairs. It's all I can do. Forget about it and focus on the next foot forward and never drive in black boots again. Just came back from chow and it was nice. Sat with Chav, Byrd, Rojas, and Tomas and had a nice dinner. We got cake after for the navy's birthday and it was hilarious. Having close friends is really great when you have those bad days.

We went to sushi masa friday night and enjoyed some food and company. Yesterday we went to the beach and it was so fun. The beaches here are so clear and warm, swimming in them is awesome. I went with Byrd, Chav, Tomas, and Rojas. We went to Langdon beach at fort pickens. Such a nice beach. I got super tan. We went to Crabs after and ate seafood. I finished Cyberpunk Edgerunners. It was a tear jerker. I really enjoyed it. I really want to stay at your house gets me every time. Besides that I'm reading On Combat and the Book Thief still. It's hard to focus on reading when there is conversations going on in the background in the compound. I'm gonna go for a run.

Tomorrow we will be getting the snoop gang which will be fun. This morning it was in the 50s when I went for a run. It's getting chilly here. Running in this temperature is really nice, I do sweat as much and it's not as suffocating. Reminds me of socal. I'm done with the screen for checkout, now I'm just awaiting order mods. Yesterday I checked out how to ship my stuff to sd. I've been reading the book thief still, it's not really clicking for me. I just can't engage in it like the other books I've been reading. Maybe because it's so hard to focus in that room. I'm getting more familiar with n92 work and getting into a routine. I'm also nearly done with Made in Abyss Season 2 and it is the most disturbing and grotesque anime I've ever seen. The part where the child who can't give birth becomes her wish and gives birth everyday to a dying child that passes away and is eaten to sustain the adventurers is just insanity. It's halloween in gw2 and the mad king festival is back. It's kind of nice experiencing it again since I missed it last year due to bootcamp. I'm nearly done listening to the Stand, on the part where the atom bomb was detonated in flag's faction by the trash can man and Stu Redman is found by the retard who successfully infiltrates as a spy. They and Kojac the dog are going back to Boulder but have to bunker down for the winter at a hotel. Every time I'm nervous about something new recently I tell myself I'm on the precipice of adventure and what awaits will only be good. Take that first step. This along with initiating social interactions is something I am continuing to work on.

Expensive but going on the rides was so fun. We got some scam festival food and went on a couple of rides. The ferris wheel was magical. It's nice to see a heighten view of where I've been living for the past year. In league only china and korea are left again. I'm rooting for SKT/T1. I'm planning on going to the beach after this and just chill there and read, may be go for a swim. I've been recovering from a cold because of the sudden temperature drop this pass week. The beaches here are so nice. I'll get back for the korean civil war game of lol.

Saturday night I watched the GenG vs DWK korean civil war game and it was a banger, super high level league of legends back and forth, 3-2 in a very balanced yet engaging meta. Sunday I went with Byrd, Amaya, and Chav to the driving range and hit some balls, then we went to the mall and got food and chilled. Good times. Last night I watched the EDG vs DRX game and it was also so good. First time I've seen a 4-1 for DRX.

Yesterday i just chilled in my room, it was rainy the entire day. It was the day of the DRX vs SKT Worlds final. A very hype 3-2 in favor of DRX. What an underdog story. Faker and Deft going to the same high school and entering the league ten years ago at the same time. Finally meeting again this year at the worlds final. I started reading Factfulness, a book about how the world is better than we think. It basically explains how humans like to dramatize things and how outdated a lot of perceptions about our worldview is. Besides getting ready to leave here, I'm gonna go to the beach today. It's gonna be an exciting day. Friday we went to McGuires for the last time. It was great as always. Soon we're gonna get breakfast at CJ's and I'm gonna get some windshield cleaner and some new wipers since they performed so poorly yesterday. Let's get it.

I'm reading a book about Factfulness in which the worldviews we have are probably outdated and misconstrued. I'm enjoying it but some parts are a slog to get through. I need to read more in general, been playing too much cyberpunk. It's such an awesome and beautiful game.

Wednesday. I'm mostly done with my checkout at this point. I've got my travel route planned out and mostly packed and ready to go. Life is good. Byrd left yesterday, it feels so bittersweet. I finished Cyberpunk on the true ending and I'm super satisfied. I couldn't ask for a better ending honestly. Amazing game. I'm excited and sad to leave. It's been an incredible experience here but my time is up. Maybe one day I'll return. Run with the wind finished very strongly and I enjoyed the slow burn sports narration. I got the new pokemon violet game and it's pretty good. Two more days.

What a crazy week it has been. I've just arrived home from my cross country road trip a couple of hours ago. 2800+ miles of the continental United States. I checked out and left Corry Station Friday morning around 0800 and drove up to Atlanta, Georgia from Pensacola. I was scared, nervous, and free. It was liberating and scary at the same time. I took on stop then went to Fernbank Science Center in northern Atlanta. That city was a shitty clusterfuck but it had a nicer area like Altadena too which was where Fernbank was. The center was cool and I enjoyed it, it was free. After that I drove westward to my stay at Georgia Palm and Gardens, wedding locale made airbnb style. It was pretty and I got to see some of the countryside of Georgia. Day 2 was intense, I left Georgia and went northeast to the Tail of the Dragon and up the great smoky mountains. Riding the tail was exhilarating; I nearly died. An unforgettable memory. 11 miles in 318 curves. So much fun in the miata and incredibly beautiful. After that I backroaded into Tennessee and went westward to Nashville. There I visited Centennial Park and the Parthenon there. That was cool and cold. I like Nashville, it felt friendly and not as crowded as other cities. I left Nashville and stayed at a Quality Inn in the western outskirts of Nashville/Kingston Springs. There I found a cozy local pizza joint that was peak cozyplaces. Everyone seemed to know each other and it was so wholesome. Day 3 I left Tennessee and drove to Little Rock, Arkansas where I visited the waterfront park area with these cool sculptures. Little Rock was weird in that the population was so low I think 64 thousand but the city was so sprawling so there was barely anyone there. I also visited the USS Razorback and had a lovely tour of that. Unplanned and fucking awesome. I stayed at Midtown Medical Center/Guest Inn and checked out a local chinese market in the ghettoish area. Felt like home away from home. On the fourth day I went straight to OKC with the usually market/gas stops along the way because the exhaustion was hitting me. I didn't like OKC because the city was super huge like LA, so a lot of driving. I did visit the museum of osteology there and got to see some cool skeletons. I got some local thai food and crashed at my hotel near the airport. The next day I went straight to Tucumcari and went to the dino museum there. The whole town was a shithole but observing the people kind of reminded me of growing up in Rosemead in the 90s. A shithole but I had fun as a kid regardless. The Days Inn there was actually probably the best hotel I stayed in to be honest. Small, cozy, clean, good shower, and a microwave. On the sixth day I dropped by the Petrified Forest National park and drove around there catching the views and visiting the shops. It was breathtaking but kind of too touristy for me. I continued on to Flagstaff where I also went to the Lowell Observatory to attend some lectures and see the exhibits and telescopes. Super wholesome and it got me out of my exhaustion. I stayed the night at the Doubletree by Hilton and it was nice but no microwave in my room... The cookies were so damn good though. This morning I drove from Flagstaff all the way home. I hate California driving. It's a free for all and rules don't matter, no passing lane, bleh. It's been a ride and my miatas held beautifully. Once I get settled in San Diego I'll clean her up and maintain her and maybe do some modifications.

Last day of my travel leave. I'm going to SD tomorrow. The break was good. Met with the families/cousins. Hung out with Andrew and Chau and his sister. Ate with Mom and Dad. Finished Kaguya-sama s1 and Andor. Time to get back on the grind.

Third day in SD. I'm somewhat checked-in now. These past three days have been overwhelming. I've been meeting people, processing stuff, and getting settled in. I'm currently living in navy gateway, inn, and suites temporarily while waiting for a barracks room. The commute to the ship isn't too bad. We're in the yards right now so there's a good bit of down time but I'm trying to get my check-in sheet fully signed by everyone. Tomorrow I'm going to try harder to get acclimated and finding people to finish checkin rather than get my hand held. The CT gang are pretty cool, very small and tight-knit. It's a strange time to join since a lot of people are leaving within a year and more people should be checking in. It's also being worked on the yard so there's very little to do so people aren't showing up. It's kind of hard being new and making new friends in a new city. I'll try harder to be more social and take initiative starting interactions and connecting. I'm feeling lonely. I'm going to see about conecting with Mozon or Swofford or some CTMs in the area. I also want to see if there's any car clubs in the area. There's also the situation of getting back on an exercise routine. These are what I want to focus on my next two weeks until holiday standdown. Let's get it.

Almost a week in SD. I'm kind of used to going to work now. I'm still just getting into the motions and going to quarters. Having so much personal time is leading me to relapse. This past saturday was awesome though. CTT Jack Rabasca invited me to his house and we hungout with CTR Howard and CTM Hutchins and a couple of others. I drank too much for me and had a massive headache. Still I had a really good time meeting everyone and hanging out, drinking and eating good food. I'm gonna miss Hutchins even though I've barely met her. I think I'll be alright. Sunday I ran errands and did laundry. Today was a fairly easy monday. Everyone seems mentally checked out for the holidays. Leave is starting next week. I'm getting in the rhythm with physical training again. This buds routine is pretty tough but simple. I like it. Hopefully it is sustainable. I'm enjoying Prout field. Tomorrow mom and dad are visiting. It's gonna be okay. I love Mono, Jack's husky border collie.

Sunday. Last week kind of just dragged by. I've gotten more situated with doing nothing really. The days were short at least and I'm well stocked in food thanks to mom and dad. They visited Tuesday and we ate vietnamese food and shopped at costco. I have a bunch of food now so that's good. On thursday I went to the LHD boxer to get some training/shadow some CTs but didn't have access to the sses. At least I can make my way there by myself now. On friday I met with the triad and it was okay. This weekend I've been a bit neurotic. I've just been so dissatisfied and lonely. Usually I can deal with it but with the increased privacy I had now, I just keep to myself and wallow in self-pity. I want to become more independent and resilient to my dissatisfaction. To do this I need to build good habits, strong relationships, and practice gratitude. Right now I'm watching Kurzgesagt videos on how to better myself. To do so I going to get out more and avoid triggers that send me down a negative feedback spiral. I want to practice social skills by volunteering; that way I can hit two bird with one stone. I'm going to go run today rain or shine and get some japanese food.

Thursday. It's been a slow week and life has been meh. Work has just been quarters and sweepers and then we go home. I've been lonely and trying to improve myself with little progress. At least I've been keeping up with my health for the most part. I'm planning on going out more but I also want to save money for next week so this weekend I'm gonna visit an art museum downtown. I'm still looking into volunteering but haven't committed to anything yet. It's hard to dedicate a chunk of time to do stuff when you have to commute there and back. I love my miata but I hate traffic. I'm almost done with Vinland Saga, it's really good. Today I finally found the place that ngis packages get redirected after going to the post office 15 mins away then the permanently closed post office on wetside then asking ngis front desk about it and being sent to a shady warehouse down the street off base. At the warehouse I searched the perimeter and found the navy fleet package center. What a crazy quest. After that I went to sweetwater park and ran the trail, it was nice. Definitely will return regularly to run.
