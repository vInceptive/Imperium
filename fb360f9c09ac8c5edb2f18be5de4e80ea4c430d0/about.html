<blockquote><p>Do people and events distract you? Stop being whirled around by things outside yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Meanwhile, avoid the opposite trap of being absorbed in the minutia of daily life. Don&apos;t weary yourself in endless activity with nothing of real accomplishment to show for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don&apos;t worry about what others think. Mind what <strong>you</strong> think. Watch the movements of your mind, and focus your thoughts on something worthy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ask yourself the important questions: What is the nature of the cosmos? What is my nature? How is this related to that? What part do I play in the whole?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No one can stop you from living according to your nature&mdash;from thinking, saying, and doing things that benefit all.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<p>Modern Translation:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do you find it difficult to focus? It is because you are concerned with things beyond yourself. (Other people/events/priorities)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>However also, avoid losing yourself to your daily grind and letting your days flyby meaninglessly. Don&apos;t wear yourself down without even noticing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ignore most of what others may be thinking, especially about you. Think about what <strong>YOU</strong> think. What is on your mind, is it about something worthy of your thought?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ask yourself: What is your purpose in this universe? What do you have that can achieve your life&apos;s purpose? What actions can you take right now to benefit the whole?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With your strengths and plan in mind, no one or thing can stop you. Your thoughts, words, and actions are now aligned with the universal way.&nbsp;</p>

<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">

<p><em>1. Make a map of your failures indicating the rough date they occurred. Write beside each one what you learned. </em></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>-Academics (2012-2013) Dropping out of college. I was immature in a sense that I blamed my failures on everything else besides my own lack of effort and character. I was also addicted to pleasure and the negative feedback loops of self-indulgence and easy rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I learned that I had no discipline and that excuses were not the answer. I didn&apos;t fully realize it at the time but over time I learned the hard way how to be more disciplined. I am grateful I made lifelong friends during this time and learned how to live by myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>-Depression (2015) Doing absolutely nothing and just existing and living with dark thoughts and having no goals or anyone to turn to was what I faced during this time. I was in terrible terms with my family and recluse to my friends. Lying in bed wanting to end it all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I learned that I never want to be in that state of living ever again and will do anything to avoid it. What got me out of the hole was that I simply decided one day that I was going to find a job and improve my life. I drove to Starbucks everyday to use their internet and applied for dozens of jobs. Shit sucked and I ended up with a dead-end job.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>-Weak (2016?) After hiking in Andrew&apos;s farewell hike to Inspiration Point and having failed to reach the top, I realized how my lifestyle was completely self-destructive and unsustainable. I felt like a hamster on a wheel. Work a dead-end minimum wage job to come home dead tired. I played videogames on my free time all day and return to nightshift. Surviving off of mass gainer. Utter shit. Also my dog disappeared. That was so painful.</p>
<p>I learned how to exercise my mind and body to become something more. I forget how but I stumbled upon a youtube channel called Improvement Pill and learned a lot about self-improvement. One especially life changing video was the recommendation on reading &quot;Tools of Titans&quot; by Tim Ferriss. This book gave my insight on the lives of world class performers and taught me a lot about their habits, routines, and mindset that branched out to a plethora of topics that I explored to improve myself or at least try to be my best. I got fit, went back to school, learned so much about the world and myself, stemming from this singular channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>-COVID-19 (2020) A dark year. Everything paused and the world I lived in paused. No more school, no more friends/family, no more outside world. A creeping darkness returns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I learned to appreciate everything I took for granted; nature, people, money, sunshine, society, health. It gave me a new perspective on how much worse life could be and had become in an instant. I had to pull myself out of the hole once more but this time, many other people were in holes all around me. Enter the Navy...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>-Love (Corry) (2022) I had my first e-girlfriend at Corry Station after joining the Navy. It was a brief love but damn did I feel invincible as if the world/universe simply worked out. Rachel was beautiful and brilliant bit it simply died off. I&apos;m not sure 100% why but I believe it may be my inexperience in romantic endeavors. I also experienced a familial bond with my CTM A-school family. We&apos;re all out of touch with each other now but I love you all and I hope you are well, Byrd, Chav, Oki, Mcvay, Anderson, Tomas, Prinzi, Womack, Amaya. &lt;3</p>
<p>I learned the value of love and relationships; how fleeting and difficult it is to develop and maintain; why it is important and to be/try to be more sociable.</p>
<p><br></p>
