            It's 2020. A new decade. The past ten years has been quite a journey. Half of high school, uci, work, self-improvement. It has been quite a decade. I look forward to the next. Yesterday I celebrated at Andrew's with family. We talked and played smash. Ryan got dunked by a Chrom amiibo. I relapsed last night. It will be the last one of the decade. Today I mostly reworked all of sheets and stuff for 2020. I finished the Witcher series on netflix. It's a decent brief summary of the first few books. I really enjoyed it.

			The first real day with structure. An okay start but not perfect. This weekend I hungout with the boys. We went bowling, Ritters, Pasadena, and Noodle World. I wasn't in the best mindset that day. Coming out of a short fast and losing in bowling. My mental state was not at the best place. Yesterday we ate dim sum at nbc. We haven't eaten there in years so it was reminiscent and nostalgic. I downloaded sleep as android and it has helped me track my sleep and get me out of bed earlier.

			<h1 id="4">Strange Unobservable Phenomenons</h1>
			<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
			More or less the same. Pretty productive day yesterday. Good workout, working on my bridge and deep pistol squats. Read a little bit of Nietzche and stretched. I read about Einstein's view on quantum physics. His main critque was that it was based on randomness and uncertain probabilities. The act of observing quantum states affects how they act. Many would say that this is how Einstein was in his young when he disproved immutable laws of the universe. I personally can see why Einstein refuses to accept quantum physics, at least that particular sector of it. I'm curious if he ever did come up with a unified theory to account for this randomness or is it still left unknown like dark matter/energy. It seems like these two cases may be eerily similar. Strange unobservable phenomenons.

			I slept on my neck weird. It's a little sore right now. Today I purchased monster hunter world Iceborn. I'm really enjoying the base game so far. It allows me to express something primal within. The hunt, sometimes humans have been doing for thousands of years until late. Speaking of hunting I need to find a better source of nutrition. Gainer shakes is not enough calories for my lifestyle. Yesterday I read about Einstein's life during WWII. I think it is fitting since Iran just launched missiles in retaliation for the assassination of one of their generals. For most of his life, Einstein was a pacifist. When he learn about the possibility of nuclear fission to produce an atomic bomb, he was one of the catalyst for the Manhattan Project. After the two bombs went off and he was assured Germany was not developing their own bombs he deeply regretted it. He feared for the future of the world when other countries became aware of the presence of such a destructive force. His worries was not unwarranted since the Cold War began a couple of decades after.

I learned a bit about the addiction process and it seems to help but even as illogical as it seems, the rewiring of the reward circuit is a very ingrained process. Simply to will against it is much easier said than done. I think this is why we should not look down upon the downtrodden. Everyone has their sins, guilt, drug of choice. We would not be imperfectly human otherwise. I can only hope to build the PFC to a point where control is second nature.

			<h1 id="11">Sacrifice</h1>
			<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
			It has been going. I've done a few days of yoga and it has helped with my mindset. I've finished jotting down the quotes for Einstein. Also finished mhw iceborn's story. I want to talk about sacrifice in that it is something everyone has to make. Sacrificing time, youth in particular to gain something more. Recently I've had trouble going to be at a reasonable hour and waking up without laying in bed getting a dopamine kick on my phone. One problem is that I've moved my phone to the bed so it can track my sleep. I don't think this is helpful. The tracking is inaccurate and I end up snoozing or browsing the web for an hour in bed. Anyways back to sacrifice. I've lost my train of thought... In order to expand our horizons one needs to develop themselves to an extent where more opportunities can occur. And I think this is where fear and doubt, indecision, sloth occurs. It's a sacrifice with uncertain outcomes. But if one can power through the initial hurdle or obstacle, they grow, things get easier. From what I've experienced and read, the inbetween starting and finishing is the most fulfilling to most. It's the most meaningful. When you look back, it isn't the award or the orgasm that is most memorable but the journey, the effort it took to get here. The sacrifice.

			I didn't mention it but I finished the book the Night Circus and returned it yesterday. It's a good book with beautiful imagery and magical themes. Although it is purely fictional, it instils in me a sense of belief in magic, mysticism, and unshackled wonder. The black and white, high contrasty theme I really enjoyed and it has influence some of my stylistic choices in my life. This morning, procrastinating out of bed, I watched Living Big in a Small Space or something like that about an architect in melbourne. His apartment studio is so simplistically beautiful that I can't stop thinking about it. It uses clever levels that defines the space, kitchen, bathroom, entryway, office, lounge. I really loved everything about it. The windows, the textures, the plants, the storage areas. Amazing. The architect himself is so well-spoken and reserved in a way that projects outwardly when he speaks and it shows in the space itself.

			<h1 id="15">Progress Report</h1>
			<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
			This is a reference to the book I'm currently reading, Flowers for Algernon. It is about a mentally retarded individual who has surgery to improve his intelligence. The whole book is written from his point of view in progress reports or journal entries he writes to the people in charge of the experiment. The beginning starts out with really mangled english and spelling. It gives a brief background pre surgery and gradually improves post-surgery. It's very interesting seeing his grammar and spelling improve along with how his thoughts develop as his memory and cognition improves. He grows more mature and intelligent, mentally and emotionally. In a way, these journal entries of mine is a way for me to write down my own progress. I've been clean for a couple of days now and I am seeing some improvements. Procrastination is still a big issue as I try to train my willpower towards more productive habits. I'm managing to knock down at least 70% of what I intend to do each day and that is something. I need to make sure that I give it my best effort though. I've noticed a drop in quality after the manic phase of recovery. More on this on porn recovery in hormones and neurotransmitters. I looked into physics books yesterday to learn and found Feynman's lectures online. I will try to incorporate those into my daily routine. I am thinking that I'm trying to do too much rather than focusing on a few things, I am doing too much and it can get overwhelming. It's a semblance to how my mind works, I do what interests me in regard to improving and growth. But I punish myself when I do not have the time to truly master it. In this negative state of mind I try to turn myself off through less meaningful activities that lead to procrastination and self-loathing, a negative cycle. To break free, simply try my best and be kind to myself, you cannot punish someone who is truly trying their best. Catch myself when I get caught in this loop. Another thing I'm trying to do is improve my confidence and be more likeable. It is hard when I stay at home 99% of the time. Practicing social interaction is a completely foreign subject I'm not sure how to approach.

			<h1 id="16">Big in Japan</h1>
			<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
			Roughly on month until I go to Vietnam and Japan. I'm feeling a little anxious about it but also a little excited. In Algernon Charlie Gordon is becoming increasingly smart. He is writing in perfect English and is reading at an incredible rate. He is beginning to understand the complexities of morality and relationships. Another thing I think the book touches on really well is insecurity. The idea that you cannot be truly yourself because of other people. He writes that he holds back because he knows others will read his work. He feel self-conscious about it, if there are flaws, overthinking what others are thinking about his writing. I too have this feeling and have dealt with this insecurity my whole life. I think it may be different with everyone. Delving into psychology I learned that my personality is especially paranoid about the thoughts of others and extra sensitive to feedback beyond myself. While this may be a bad thing, it has helped me in learning and improving. I always look to outside sources to improve my own understanding and frameworks. What I've learned that helped me deal with this paranoia feedback loop of self-consciousness is that it is a pointless activity. You cannot possibly know everything about a person. You can ask and clarify and better yourself in socializing. So to become crippled by this anxiety is irrational in that making these likely false assumptions will likely backfire or be useless in the utilitarian sense. Don't make assumptions. Regardless it is very interesting to see Charlie develop. Another topic I want to discuss is the idea of smiling. I've always found it strange to smile when I am not happy. Over the years, I've learned that acting or projecting a certain body/facial language can affect the mood itself. Act how you feel and feel how you act. It is not a one way street as many would think. But I digress, while looking at myself in the mirror while working out today, I snapped a photo of myself staring with no emotion and one where I was smiling a knowing smile, with a slight head tilt. I compared the two photos and they both give off two different vibes. Although I want to preface that I did switch lenses, 2.8f 24mm vs 1.8f 50mm, nonetheless the angle and smile really changed the photo's mood entirely. As I reasoned why that is the case beside that primal recognition to make sure on is safe through body and facial language, I think it also has to do with curvature. Humans are innately drawn towards S-curves. We see it in design, art, and sensuality. What smiling does is raise the cheeks in a way that when viewing from different angles, creates a subtle S-curve down towards the chin and it is attractive to look at when compared to the flat or bumpy jowls of a smileless face.

			<h1 id="17">Lunar New Year</h1>
			<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
			In flowers for algernon, the protagonist has reached an intelligence that has surpassed those of his experiementers. The main event that I empathized with what the alienation from his work family. He is fired because people feel inferior when interacting with him. I think that sometimes I give off this vibe too. Being unable to grasp the topic in conversations leads people to feel insecurity or lacking in knowledge. They zone out or feel stupid and therefore threatened. The book covers this very well when Charlie outgrows his work and his relationship with Alice Kinnian. It is summed up perfectly when he described her as a goddess to lover to companion to savior. The attachment changes from worship to fear to lust/love to platonic and finally appreciation and nothing more. I think as humans we are biologically programmed to love as so the concept of outgrowing love intellectually is such a foreign concept. I believe Einstein once put that the natural state of human beings is that of a polyamorous animal rather than monogamous. As such if even the brightest individual of our time cannot overcome such instinct, I should not be so arrogant to believe that I am beyond that myself. Another topic I explored yesterday was Nietzche's true world as a way to deal with nihilism, suffering, and the meaning of life. It was interesting to consider that there are three forms of true world theories: temporal, monistic, and eternal true worlds. As a preface, Nietzche liked to refer to the separation of physical reality and metaphysical reality as the "ascetic ideal." An ideal that one can reach the true world by following a lifestyle, usually based on human defined "goodness" from a higher being. Anyways I never realized it but I am a firm believer in the temporal true world theory. Basically there is no distinction between two realities but rather a utopian ideal of the physical realm that lies not in a metaphysical realm, but in the future. The other forms is monistic, in which everything is connected, the universe and individual are one and there is a deity everything is apart of that is infinitely superior. Therefore to act in a way to benefit all things is the foremost ideal of life. I think this is similar to Einstein's theological beliefs but to a certain logical degree. Finally the eternal true world is similar to the Christian idea of heaven and hell, that one's immortal true self will manifest after death in the after life based on how one lives in this life.

			824. Yesterday we went to Nathan's for lunar new years. We ate chai and I got to see Bo and Thieu. We talked and played upstairs. We played some switch games, it was not bad. I cried a lot yesterday. Probably more than I have this past decade. Yesterday morning Kobe and his daughter passed away. Helicopter crash in the morning. It instilled in me a tremendous sense of vulnerability and pain. One of the strongest individuals on Earth simply gone in an instance. It was a day of mourning. The horseman of death has at last arrived. I cried when we got home last night. It was near the end of Reckful and Pokimane's scuffed podcast. I think they were simply taking about Reckful's life and his need to prove himself. I don't really remember why I cried, it was just relatable and genuine about family and seeing Reckful talk about being vulnerable. I pretty much grinded MHW the rest of the night. I wasn't feeling sleepy around midnight so I binged some doujinshi and porn throughout the entire night. It was really bad, currently on <3 hours of sleep and I missed my morning workout. The silver lining is that I somehow got into erotic webtoons. I read this webtoon called Fatal Woman. It was about this beautiful Korean team manager of a videogame company with a painful past and present. She is doing okay except in relationships. The webtoon itself was pretty intense. It doesn't censor anything with regards to humanity's primitive self. There are themes of greed, lust, obsesssion, poisonous gossip, loneliness, infidelity, rape, suicide, and revenge. Feeling quite vulnerable, I cried whenever I could empathized. The character development and art really stood out to me and I will read some more sfw webtoons.

			<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
			There is a virus that is plaguing the world right now. It started in Wuhan, China and currently there are 5,000 confirmed cases and about 100 deaths. That is a proportionately small size so I am not worried. I haven't been as productive as I used to be this past week. I have noticed that I'm sensitive and prone to tearing up when I read about something sad or humanly relatable. Yesterday I edited some new years photos of my parents and truly looking at there faces for first time in a while got me feeling regret. They are getting older and have done so much for me, thinking about what I owe them and their sacrifices hit hard. I'm trying to finish some projects I've been working on on and off. I want to finish them because I feel like I'm split between so many things that I end up doing nothing. Although this may not be the correct mindset to have. It's the process not the product that really matters. Maybe I need to focus simply on starting rather than what happens when I finish. I slept a good ten hours today so I feel better.

			Another day of inconsistency. I slept really late messing around with my Steam profile. It's an interesting thing how far people have taken it. I ended up with something I am happy with but not satisfied with. This really messed with my sleep time and again, everything is pushed back. Thinking back, last year, the inter-session of modern dance was really enjoyable. I put in effort and it felt like I was really working at something. The daily consistency was key. I think this is why people toil and work. It gets them busy and out of their heads. Without this constant business, people fall into nihilism and negative thoughts. I sound like I am complaining about my own will to power and inability to maintain consistency. I am to a degree but I realize that this negativity is a harmful feedback loop. I think that to reject nihilism and grow in life is to work towards this temporal true world.

			Another late start day. The reason for last night's blunder is FeH. Lif? mythic hero battle. I didn't clear it until 4 or 5 am. All for a stupid gold hat. I'm blaming this but really I'm blaming myself. I lack the self control to moderate my time spent I realize. I could go hours on something if I feel like it is important or entertaining. The problems lies in the value of splitting my time on it. I think one problem is that I don't have a defined endgoal. Many have some goal set as motivation to work and live. Here is where I am lacking. What am I working towards? What do I want? That's the million dollar question. I contemplate this as a means to question nihilism in general. Yesterday I finished Genealogy of Morals and left feeling uncertain about the path forward. It explains the ascetic ideal in that suffering towards an ideal is a means to deal with ourselves and existence. In the end I am left with more uncertainties and the questioning of scientific beliefs and values. Speaking of endings, I finished Kimetsu no Yaiba (blade of demon destruction) and it was good. I like the world they've built and colorful characters.

			I spent most of yesterday playing guild wars 2 wvw. Something so familiar roaming around EBG, I could do it for hours even when there's no fights. In mhw i'm reaching endgame now that I am MR 100. I stayed up late watching Rush get masters in LoL. I went to sleep around 3 and I didn't find out until I watched the VoD. He had to do promotions 9 times to get out of diamond. It goes to show no matter how talented you are, the effort and willingness to try again when you fail is much more important. I woke up at 9 ish this morning but stayed in bed on my phone reading webtoons... This is a bad habit I've picked up... I got through my workout. Left arm is feeling a little tight from the tuck L-sits. For lunch mom made some garlic air fried chicken. It was really good, salty and garlicy. I want to try and finish Photographer's Eye so I can focus on Physics but the motivation is lacking. There is something strange with me this week. Hormonal imbalance and irregularity in sleep is the two prime suspect.

			There's going to be a huge shift in how combat works in guild wars 2. A lot of the changes are posted on the forums. Mostly power coefficients getting lowered and cooldowns/instantcast skills being nerfed longer. Passive defense skills are taking a hit too. It's going to shift the meta to a more timing based/slower time to kill gameplay. Less one shots and more CC based I think. I am past half way in my 30 day yoga journey. It's been good, helping me get past the negativity of myself and what has happened. The sessions are like meditation combined with stretches and core work. I've come to adore Adriene, such a dearess. In Algernon, Charlie and Algernon has escaped and moved to a flat near times square. Charlie has a neighbor who becomes his lover and helps him realize and overcome the past Charlie that still resides in his subconscious. This goes into psychology and the maturity of the mind through life experience. I wonder if people can mature intellectually and emotionally. It is so difficult to quantify psychological concepts to produce a clear cut methodology to mature as person. It's strange that I used to think that after a certain point of intellectual growth one would be able to distance oneself from human necessities. But even if you understand the process and we are still human. One thing that stood out to me was when Charlie and Fey (neighbor) were a good match personality and needs wise, they had differences. Charlie could not appreciate her lifestyle and keep up with her dancing free spirit while Fey could not appreciate Charlie's concerto and intellectual interests. And Charlie makes a note about polygamy something that Einstein hinted at too. This makes me think about Kramer in Seinfeld about how marriage is a man made prison. I don't know, just some interconnected thoughts. Algernon is not doing so well at this point, hurting himself and his female play-mice, seemingly depressed. Foreshadowing? I went on a nice bike ride today, it was 25C and my sister bought me Yoshinoya. I spent the afternoon creating an artwork of Kobe for my steam profile. I think it turned out good. Yesterday Lebron gave a speech on the tragedy before the game and it really hit hard.

			It has been a pretty uneventful weekend. I stayed home and played videogames mostly. I'm approaching the end of the mhw grind. Finishing up my sets with health regen from tempered Namielle etc. It is a pretty complex game in terms of stat calculation and formula. I've put in about 150 hours so far. Also have been playing gw2 a lot again. We are matched against SoS and all they do is ppt so we took their keep every afternoon and hold it until late night, farming them. I've been thinking about my productivity recently. Last month I spent 64% of my time on entertainment on my pc. That is 284 hours or 12 days. Almost half the month. When I created my routine I expected too much maybe. Creating so many habits is difficult to maintain. I think I am still in a good place. I'm moving past the troubles of the previous week. Today it was very windy. In Algernon Charlie is pouring himself into his work, trying to find out what is wrong with Algernon by researching everything relating to the experiment. He talks about trying to save those in the future like his old self and about how time exists differently for him. It is very similar to what I've learned to consider as flow. Balance meta shift patch tomorrow.

			It's cold. This is the excuse I make to stay in bed or procrastinate. I remember trying to teach myself to love the cold two years ago. It feels like a lot time ago. Things have been really good in terms of exercise. I have been keeping at it consistently. Everything else, not so much. I end up taking breaks longer than I intended. Sleep wise I am well rested at 7.5 hours a day. My irregularity is off by 150% though. I am nearly done with Flowers for Algernon. Charlie has come up with an explanation on why they are regressing. Algernon has died and Charlie goes to visit his mother and sister. It is a touching reunion but uncomfortable since his mother has alzheimer and lapses into forgetfulness often. The scene makes me reflect on my own life and rethink the bond between my family and how grateful I should be that we are relatively whole. I question the picturesque ideal of a perfect family both psychologically and physically; and how I can be a better parent when that inevitability comes. On an unrelated note, I'm having fun responding to SOS flares in mhw and farming grinding lands. Gw2 balance patch isn't until next week and my Adidas slippers arrived today, earlier than I expected, in a giant ass box.

			Everything is going to be alright. Maybe I am wasting time, procrastinating, spending too much time on entertainment but I'm not dead. I think humans are often too hard on ourselves. We set incredibly tough standards and try to accomplish them. It's a good and bad thing. As with most things there are two sides, binary with space inbetween. As long as we do, succeed or fail it matters not. I'm setting up a shelf on top of my shelf today to manage space better. I'm also planning to get more plants in my room. Green has a calming property and removes toxic chemicals from the air. I learned a bit about cancer yesterday and added some literature to my reading list. Yesterday was the Rajang patch for mhw and I cleared once. I look forward to farming him for the next month.

			Relapsed on Thurs late night. I ate dinner at grandma's. We had ho thieu. It was delicious. I finished Flowers for Algernon when I was there. The ending was so sad. What Stories of Your Life and Others didn't have was the human side that Algernon exemplified really well. Charlie regression of intelligence is so so so sad. In a way it is like life. We grow strong and then we grow weak and die. The mystery of love really hit hard to me, Charlie's average intelligence state describing what love is is so damn perfect. I wrote it down in quotes for mentors. And when Charlie regresses until the point where he is old Charlie and looks for his old job back and his old friends and coworkers accepts him. I teared up. Anyways I noticed that I was awake that day, I couldn't fall asleep and stayed up on my phone. In other news, I have constructed my table shelf and my parlour plant is here, along with my saber. I feel a little bit more happy but not fulfilled if that makes sense. In a way I always feel like this after binging/relapse. It's a feeling like a dreary cloudy day and you are stuck inside a room with no way out. Your mind feels heavy like a weight is holding it down while you think about a way to escape but this weight is too heavy and you just sleep; not the kind of sleep that you welcome but the sleep that is because being awake is too stressful. This afternoon I slept in a biked to the library to return F for Algernon.

			<h1 id="28">Snow Crash</h1>
			<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
			I've been reading Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson recently. It is a cyberpunk style dystopian future or alternate timeline where things become super edgy and contrasty. The main character is named Hiro Protagonist who is a pizza delivery driver for the mafia and also a renown hacker. Super edgy stuff. The story is actually believable if you suspend your disbelief and it becomes more like a ride, entertaining and you don't have to think too much. Granted I am listening to the audiobook which I think would be more enjoyable than reading it. Yesterday I watched Reckful's weekly sunday stream. He was having tea time with Mizkif and they were bet large sums of money on randomly generated numbers. It was interesting to see the problems and thought process behind someone who has so much financially but suffer from so much mentally. I worked out this afternoon and cooked a nice jajang? ramen meal with cauliflowers, eggs, and shrimp. Yummy. I'm thinking that it may be a good idea to go find a job that deals with manual labor again. Listening to the TF podcast during my workout with Kevin Costner, he worked as a house framer before his acting career began during his early twenties. He talked about finding that thing that makes you lose track of time, something he had in his childhood.

			<h1 id="30">Active Nihilism</h1>
			<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
			Thursday afternoon. I'm doing better. School and vacation is coming up. I'm excited, I am going to get my international drivers license to go carting in Tokyo. My plants are here. Today is the final day of my 30 day yoga journey. It is definitely a good habit to build. I feel more lithe, graceful, and refined. I have been watching Netflix's Sex Education and it is pure gold. I haven't laughed aloud quite this hard in awhile. It was much needed. The show also goes into depth on the taboo aspects of human relationships and societal norms in the modern era. I am thoroughly enjoying it. The characters, scenes, and dialogue is simply brilliant. I notice that the habits I build are ones that are practical in a sense that it helps me in the future. But maybe I am using this as an excuse for why I can't maintain "good" habits. Dropping bad habits like browsing youtube, twitch, reddit and binging in bed are dopamine fuel and is so easy to maintain. I need to associate the dopamine to things like language learning and guitar practice. It is hard because the dopamine to fuel these habits aren't as strong. Whereas the reward from yoga is clear and prominent. Today I learned about active and passive nihilism. So we know what nihilism is, the shattering of one's pre-existing meaning for life. Like getting heartbroken and believing that love doesn't exist. Passive nihilist would give up their individualism towards a mass revolution. Things like Nazism, Totalitarianism, Communism are the result of passive nihilism. This past century in particular has been filled with revolutions as the fall of religion and faith become lost and people become swept away in nihilism. Existential angst. They search for something to fill the void, to become part of something bigger than themselves. I think this is one reason why people are so willing to waste their time with work. Of course there is compensation and psychological reward involved but internally, people want to passively avoid the nihilism in this way. Active nihilism is a complete restructuring of one's core values, meaning, and beliefs. According Nietzche and Academy, when one rids oneself of all the beliefs and attachments which previously gave life meaning, the active nihilist stands alone in the universe, a true independent free spirit able to create meaning instead of having it imposed on them by an authority figure. The next lecture will give some insights on how Nietzsche overcame nihilism by revaluing suffering.

			I woke up late today, rough night trying to stay up for no particular reason. Yesterday I finished my 30 days of yoga with Adriene. It was fun and wonderful. I wish I could tell you that it changed my life in a epiphemic way but alas it is not so. I think in terms of mindset I'm better off than before. There has been a slight increase in confidence and improvement in my posture. I played three hours straight of gw2 yesterday. We were matched up against Northern Shiverpeaks and they were fat. We fought them pretty well in their keep and around for the first hour and a half then our numbers started dwindling. That was when it go interesting. We had 10-20 v 30-40 so it was stacked against us but we held our own using kiting and mag tactics. They kept trying to take SoS's stuff while we picked them off after they kept wiping against us on our territory. Fun stuff. I think my parents are going to NorCal this weekend. I've seen six episodes of Sex Education and it is really good. I teared up a few times; it's like a RomCom that doesn't hold back and strips reality down to its bare skin.

			First day of classes today. Parking was a nightmare. I only have fencing this semester until I can talk with a counsellor about transferring classes and what is left to take. I went to do that after fencing today but they couldn't do my entire education plan at the moment. I went to the temple city library after to pickup a book; it seems that the library is under renovations for 18 months. I came home, ate and played fire emblem and watched twitch. I felt tired waking up earlier than usual so I went to bed with my phone and binged porn for hours... Yesterday I binged and finished Sex Education season 2. I think it turned out alright, relationships were refreshed, a bunch of cliffhangers. It's my favorite romcom. I'm am about to do yoga for cyclists with Adriene.

			Just finished watching a twitch rivals where my boy Shiphtur wonnered. The team was called team silver mid with Fog, Metaphor, Lily, and Celine. They went 11-1 and won, good stuff. Yesterday I finished Fire Emblem Cindered Shadows and tried to do what would make today great. We had our first fencing workout today. It was familiar and nice. I feel pretty good. I'm about to do a quick yoga session and some physics. Yesterday I learned about the categories of particles: baryons, mesons, and leptons. I also touched on the four types of forces and nuclei interactions. In philosophy I finally learned about overcoming nihilism. According to Nietzsche, we must look within ourselves and find that one calling which differs for everyone. It is why many do not fit into the societal cookie cutter world we have built. The metaphysical purpose of oneself and do everything within us to accomplish this endeavor. We will be met with tribulations and suffering along the way and this is good. Suffering is the pathway to greater wisdom and growth. Many fear suffering and pain; this is why they cannot overcome nihilism or recess to mass ideologies or beliefs.

			I went to my History of California class today. It wasn't as bad as the ratings online make it. The professor is practical and realist. Straight to the point, no sugar coating. I liked it and I didn't fall asleep like I usually do. I learned a lot about California in that three hours and some tips to improve how I learn. Stuff that I have learned in the past but never really implemented like spaced repetition and meaningful notetaking. Overall not a bad experience. Did you know that California was named after Queen Califia from a popular spanish novel in the 1500s? Didn't know that until today. When I got back I watched Jake get destroyed in the Apex twitch rivals and then relapsed. A combination of weariness and missing workout habit and stress from it. Week one down. I was procrastinating everywhere on the Internet until I tuned into a random Reckful stream where he was showing chat a Sam Harris meditation and we did it together. I fell half asleep but after I felt much better. Before I was lazy, hazy, and tired. After I felt good, I just took a shower, did the dishes, and now I'm going to do some yoga and implement some practiced repetition to my Physics. Oh yeah, yesterday I covered Physics in relation to other sciences. I relearned the complexities of chemistry, biology, and things in between. How cells work. DNA as a blueprint, RNA as a fraction that instructs ribosomes, proteins/amino acids that are triggered by enzymes to build living material from basic elements into complex molecules.

			<h1 id="37">Man of Action</h1>
			<img src="line.png" id="cleanline">
			Interestingly while procrastinating on youtube last night, I stumbled upon Universal Man's youtube video series on becoming a man of action. While motivating, it also clearly explains the process and problems with the modern lifestyle. It is very modern Nietzsche in that it addresses how nihilism is akin to being an npc in a protagonist's story. Rather than being a man of intention, one that intends to do thing, something I struggle with with my half assed improvement practices and constant failures, one should work towards being a man of action, the protagonist, the one who goes on a journey by struggling towards their dreams. The first step is to cut out all the highly stimulating, low value aspects of life, social media, gaming, porn, drugs, addictions, television/online media things that give meaningless dopamine fixes. This is the dopamine detox. The reasoning behind this is to make one's boredom or hunger greater than their fear and anxiety. This is why people stay npcs or nihilist. They fill the void with junk entertainment because the latter is too painful/too much suffering. An analogy for this is eating healthy. If one has binged on junk food and has them readily available in the kitchen they will eat that instead of the vegetables. However if one has just fasted for a week and only has broccoli in the fridge, it will be the best meal they have ever eaten.

			It's Monday and I've done my workout. I slept in because I was feeling tired. Interestingly my deficit/surplus total is near 0 for 7.5 hours a night. I think that is a really good sign of my sleep total but doesn't show the inconsistency of my fall asleep and wakeup times. Anyways I've read most of the metascript method for journalling and it is a little confusing. It makes a lot of sense practically but is more fluff than I would like and some explanations are unclear. I'll try and summarize it based on the notes and a skim over. Our brains are a lot like RAM. Fast memory that forgets easily. We want to write stuff down so that thoughts are crystallized and remembered. The method starts with finding critical moments in your life that is like a fork in the road, when you do good or bad. When you break out of autopilot and operate on relatively good thinking. To get good thinking we need to identify your main objective(s) and focus on it. We need to change three think so that these good habits help towards the main objective: our intention (action), our script (thinking about the benefits of good habit), and our metascript (beliefs/emotions about ourselves with regard to the habit). So action, thinking, and beliefs. Action involves simply doing/replacing towards the main objective. Thinking involves learning about the benefits/drawbacks of habit. Beliefs involves learning about what you love and hate about the habit and the rationalizations with it from both perspectives (doer/non-doer). Once we have the three parts we implement it as supplement it with retroactive, preemptive, and responsive journal entries that I haven't fully understood yet.

			I'm feeling a lot better. I haven't been the best in terms of productivity but I'm solidifying my core habits, sleep, exercise, and nutrition. I started reading about Salvador Dali. His autobiography is all over the place. Either this guy is on another level of genius or he is completely nuts. He grew up a pampered spoiled Spaniard and has emotional breakout periodically. I don't know what to think all I know is it makes for an interesting life. Yesterday was the gw2 big balance patch. I've spent most of my time there. Huge damage nerfs across the board, longer cooldowns, and increased emphasis on cc. Back to reality.

			Sometimes things don't go as planned and that is okay. I had a productive day yesterday. I learned about energy in physics. It's a quantity that has many forms based on how it is derived. The total amount of energy in an instance is always fixed based on the conservation of energy law. I don't know if this applies to certain frame of reference or the entire universe. We also touched on the main forms of energy, gravitational (potential), kinetic, electrical, nuclear, and mass; the six conservation laws. Not very interesting stuff but fundamental to understanding the world and universe. My mindfulness practice with Sam Harris has been really good. I've been catching myself throughout the day lost in the stream of thought and bringing myself back to reality, training my focus and staying in the actual present. I'm noticing that I lost a lot of time to daydreaming or mindlessness.

			It's been four days. Weird how this year February has 29 days. It has been a decent few weeks. Did some cycling on Saturday. On Sunday I went hiking with the boys. It was our Inspiration point round two. We reached the top this time. It's funny because we go lost and increased the trail by 1.6 miles at one point but I didn't really feel it until the latter half of castle canyon. It hailed hard during the first half of the hike. It felt super surreal and amazing. I was in the moment for most of it. I noticed that a lot of my pain was from going down I would roll my ankle and smash my foot on rocks. Not very gracefully, resulting in soreness. Although after some yoga and a day of rest I'm almost 100%. After that we ate ayce sushi at Yes Sushi and went hunting for boba ice cream at four different supermarkets. None of them had it. Yesterday was a "bad" day. I spent it recovering, little productivity, relapses. Today I went fencing and it was better. I cooked some fried chicken and took a nap. I made an effort to initiate conversations during class and my one liners were pretty good, go a few smiles, it felt good. I am going to be more open with people, be out of my head more, more open. Tim Ferriss' weekly challenge has been interesting and fun. Last week's was make eye contact with people until they smile and break it first, if they confront you about it just say you thought they looked like an old friend. This week's challenge is to learn to propose; basically make decisions, offer suggestions, propose solutions or just be more decisive.

			It has been okay. I notice that I have a lack of interest lately. It has to do with frying my dopamine receptors monday. We proceed. Fencing went pretty well yesterday. It was warm and nice. I went to class this morning and we learned about the Californio/Mexican and American war. After I worked out and eat. I'm feeling kind of tired right now both mentally and physically. I think it ties with my sleeping and eating habits. Im getting 5-6 hours of sleep and eating a lot of carbs, mainly rice, dextrose grain, and flour based vietnamese food. I've reached post time skip on my goldeen deer fe3h run. Chapter 13 was especially painful on maddening since I didn't reach up most of the golden deer units. I'm excited for tonight's Bucks vs Lakers game. Number one in the west vs east.

			This weekend was a blur. I spent most of my time in escapism. The stock market has been going down partly due to the corona virus and I've been profiting from that on the stock sim. I'm juggling three games pretty hardcore right now. The balance patch in gw2 has created quite the interesting meta. Necros and rev were over tuned and nerfed in pvp. In mhw a patch for stygian zynogre is coming along with the saijiva siege. In fe3h I'm nearing the lv 30 master classes for all my units.

			Back on track. Man my keyboard is a little fucked. The 'a' key keeps on double pressing. It's really annoying. Yesterday was semi productive. I did some strength yoga after my workout so I was really sore. I need more protein. Today was the easiest money I've ever made. I placed a call option for disney stocks yesterday and it went up. Bought it for 250 and sold for 400. I was not expecting a one day return. In fencing we started touches on people today. It was cool being able to teach the young uns something. It's been rainy and I kind of like it.

			The market is crashing. The sky is crying and the virus is spreading. It seems like the perfect dooms day scenario. The funny thing is I am certain everything will be alright in the future. People are profiting from the crash too. Yesterday I decided that I will be porn free from now on after a relapse. I looked into the reboot regimen and ways to become a better man. Day one is today. Stygian Zinogre was released yesterday. I had a blast learning the fight and finally hit MR 150.

			My classes are canceled or moved online due to the corona virus. This morning I woke up around 7:30 checking stocks and a man alerted us that our electrical line was damaged and apparently sparking. I called Edison and they sent someone to fix in like 10 minutes, I was astounded at how fast they fixed it. I did a good workout and finished Jaime Foxx's TF podcast. That man is funny and smart. I look forward to reviewing the transcript. I watched Rob's VOD yesterday, he's very socially adept, making small talk in Japanese with randoms and making friends with all the local street vendors.

A county wide shutdown occurred that night due to the corona virus. All entertainment and restaurants shut down. I invested a decent sum of money yesterday on a market crash. I went cycling this afternoon, it was pretty cold. The sun is out and it has came out periodically making beautiful weather. I've been playing gw2 a lot due to the situation and balance patch.

			My consistency with journaling is not very good much like a lot of thing in my life now. I was a week and so into being porn free until last night. I was triggered after late night reading on Reddit and a comment linked a pornstar's subreddit and down the rabbit hole I went. This entire week has been inconsistent if anything. Sleep, fitness, productivity, entertainment. It hasn't even been a week of social distancing yet... I didn't really feel that motivation to do more from refraining from porn but I wasn't a complete degenerate. Overall I made about $300 on stocks this week, I lost about $100 on learning options. Not too bad. I want to be more consistent this coming week and more productive. Retrain habits with better ones. Safijiva was released yesterday and I had fun with the event. I'm on the last chapter of the golden deer for fe3h. I notice that I get distracted easily at night and in the morning by my phone so I'm going to stop tracking my sleep and leave it on my desk and hide it in the drawer first thing in the morning. It's just not worth losing 3-5 hours of my day to procrastinating on reddit/feh/discord/youtube for sleep tracking. Consistency. Oh yeah yesterday I did some fencing drills and it started to rain hard. I think I'll continue to train in the worst conditions, it teaches you to appreciate the normalcies in life.

			Small update. I made some coconut cocoa ice cream with boba. Apparently we don't have table sugar so I improvised with powdered sugar for the syrup but it wasn't sweet enough. I hope it turns out alright. It's pretty pricey though, like $5 for two cups. I promised myself that I would focus on reading, exercise, sleep, and nutrition more. Yesterday I finished the golden deer path and with fe3h in general. Good lore, interesting characters, the best fire emblem game. My parents want me to buy toilet paper since they are limiting it to one per household. We are hoarding and I don't want to be responsible for future problems based on this hoarding.

It is too distracting and I don't know how else to keep from relapsing. It's time to focus on what I truly want from life. I've started Awaken the Giant Within and Siddhartha.

I melted and separated the boba and refroze it with brown sugar and it was really good. Listened to some good music and did my test online. Read some Siddhartha to end the night. Sleep is still inconsistent and market is going up? Weird times. What I learned so far from Siddhartha is that eye contact is extremely important, one must follow their own path in life, and the most perfect doctrines are flawed in that the experience of say Christ, Buddha, etc cannot be replicated or experienced and thereby impersonal.

Salvador Dali has been interesting. He is really spoiled, insane, and genius such a strange combination but he got me drawing again and it looks pretty good. I'm entering focus state for a bit these nights. In Siddhartha I'm getting good notes about how to live a sublime life. He is currently a student of a merchant and consort.

That game is empathetic experience that really opened up my eyes to psychosis and Norse lore. I extremely recommend. <blockquote> "Never forget what it is like to see the world as a child, Senua: where every autumn leaf is a work of art; every rolling cloud, a moving picture; every day a new story. We too emerge from this magic, like a wave from the ocean, only to return back to the sea. Do not mourn the waves, the leaves and the clouds. Because even in darkness the wonder and beauty of the world never leaves. It's always there, just waiting to be seen again." </blockquote>

			In physics I learned about symmetry in that a thing appears the same before and after an operation. It's an interesting concept because it heavily relies on the relative concept of time but provides an agreed upon fixed point to conduct physics. Translational and rotational shifts are symmetrical in this universe. A vector is a directed quantity as opposed to undirected scalars. This was the gist of vector physics. I had a tough workout this afternoon. I started extremely late because I spent time playing the reddit april fools game. This year redditors answer a question: What makes you human? A bot will produce its own response based on redditor's responses and redditors will try to find the imposter answer from a list of five. Interesting but not too innovative. I got a 40% detection rate, it was more difficult since some responses were "dumber" than the bot responses and some bot responses had some logic to it. And on top of that some humans were trolling and/or tried to impersonate the bot too.

			Yesterday I finished Awaken the Giant Within. The final exercise was to list your goals, personal, business, adventure, contribution goals. It was cathartic in a way to see my future before me and focus the direction of it towards it. In a way I have learned the methods of these improvements before just worded differently. I notice I have trouble taking action from knowledge. But yeah I want to digitize some of what I wrote down yesterday here. I also had a group chat on discord with Andrew, Annie, and Steven. I played Firewatch together and it was very engrossing. At first I thought the ending was so average and maybe that was the charm of it, refreshing to see a game where nothing really significant happens. Then I discovered the hidden clues and interactions between Delilah and Ned and Henry. I really enjoyed the couple of hours of that game.

			Pain, tired, lax, practice, suffering, disappointment, good, relief, confused, satiated, daze, interested, hopeful... I'm going to start each entry with a chronological string of emotions I felt until now since yesterday. I think it is important to review why I felt this way and try to reason it into something beneficial. I forgot to mention I had a good conversation with Derek on Saturday. I changed my chair to unlocked back movement so I'll have to support my back mostly through posture. This will improve my lower back in the long run I think.

			Quarantine week 4? Really degenerate day. Slept at 6 and woke up at 2. Didn't get cardio and Spent the day trying to get Valorant closed beta access and fooling around. Degeneracy unleashed and relapses. Spent the later half planning to improve my cable management and preparing for my new microphone setup. At least homemade food is good. Mom made really good bo. The spiciness is just perfect, give you a strong kick that you almost want to cough but it's aromatic and doesn't overpower the taste of the broth.

			Saturday. Most of my stuff for my desk project has arrived except for the microphone setup. I began the silhouette for the skyline yesterday, it is looking really good. I want to start programming and assembling the LED but I think finishing the cardboard is my main priority. While making notes for the excerpt on Siddhartha yesterday I gained a lot of spiritual insights. The main one is the distinction and wholeness of physical and spiritual. Physical reality manifests itself through thoughts, feelings, and senses. Spiritual reality, specifically, one's inner voice guides one through though, feeling, and sense. We have words for these, intuition, instinct, what feels right. Enlightenment isn't set path, it varies between individual yet it is the same for all. Difficult to explain a spiritual manifestation with physical words. I hope this is clear.

			I finished Disco Elysium last night. I was kind of expecting a huge mind blowing plot twist but it was a little plain like Firewatch. I wasn't expecting the game to end so abruptly too. I finished the game in 6 ingame days. The absurdism of the insect was cool but I was disappointed how little my choices mattered and that I had little control over the shootout/fate of Harry. But in a way I think that is why the game shines. It's a reflection of reality and how normal or absurd it can be. It doesn't hold your hands or explain anything, you kind of blunder around and do what you think is right. In the end nothing matters. I think the most memorable part of Disco Elysium was finding the body of the man who hit his head on the pier bench and investigating it. It connected with the woman who I bothered in front of the bookstore jokingly that her husband was missing earlier. Telling her about it was so saddening and one of the more emotional thing I have done in a videogame.

			Relapsed after a nice streak. It's not easy to stop when I get triggered. I caught myself and understood the ramifications of continuing but persisted I did. I felt lonely after starting No Man's Sky last night. Just being alone in the vastness of space and being so insignificant and powerless, it's truly lonely and a little humbling. While exercising I listened to Tim's Seneca letter on fasting and festivities. It introduces the idea of set aside a few days to experience poverty by depriving yourself of first world necessities so that you can experience that it isn't so bad. Eat cheap foods, no technologies, no internet, no phone similar to a dopamine fast but less strict. I'm going to do it after I finish my project. I started my biweekly 24 hour fast today. I did okay this week and I'm proud of how far I've gone. Better to focus on what works and drop what didn't. Don't feel obligated to play videogames.

			Boy it has been warm. I programmed by NodeMCU yesterday. I ran into so many problems and issues and it didn't even work in the end. I suspect it is not supplying enough power into the strip so I bought an external power supply. This is becoming more costly than buying a premade strip. I finished the story in NMS. I just started the base in New Lennon Colony and it's been addicting. In MHW they released MR Kulve Taroth. That set looks sexy as hell. Thursday we also went to grandma's for prayer, ate the usually fried foods and homemade veggies and lobster. Today I played nms and went cycling in the evening. Sister got me some honeydew milk tea and cold noodles from meettea and mom made some hainan chicken. There was a sick ingame Tavis Scott concert in Fortnite the other day. I welcome the future.

The evga gtx 1660ti arrived today. That was fast. I have it installed and I'm using it atm. I am just off of my 36 hour fast. It wasn't as easy as my 24 hour ones. There was a constant steady gnawing hunger after 24 hours. I thought it would subside after I slept and the ghrelin subsides but it did not. I was feeling anxious as hell. Like I was on adrenaline. Some morning meditation helped me realize this and I was able to exercise and endure fast winds while cycling. After my shower and breaking the fast my limbs and muscles are feeling sore especially my forearms. It's not bad but it's consistent. Yesterday I watched the WIL on depression. It is apparently a bodily reaction to perceived inflammation similar to lethargy when you are ill. It's basically mental illness just like physical illness. Depression stems from the things that cause inflammation, mental stress, lack of nutrients, lack of sleep, social isolation, obesity, lack of exercise, lack of minerals, low perceived socio-economic status etc. It's not a chemical imbalance as people are treating it but rather a physical imbalance that mimics old hunter-gathering reaction to being incapacitated. For example you don't feel like socializing when you're sick because you don't want to spread the illness to your tribe and your body is aware that it is compromised and interaction could infect you further.

Another problem with project skyline. The leds don't work at all. I plug everything in and it simply won't turn on. There was one spooky moment when I dropped it and some wires became unplugged and the first led turned on but shut off shortly after. This is really becoming more problematic and costly than simply buying a pre programmed LED. Worked out this afternoon. We had a musician and a poet on the TF podcast today. I'm currently listening to Plato's The Republic. He basically has a discussion with how societal government should be setup in a democratic sense. With Guardians as leaders and bronze/iron as its people. The description of it sounds a lot like civilized anarchy with an emphasis on freedom. He also talks a bit about age and wisdom from age.

It's getting cooler. I cut my hair today. I got angry twice today.

I was right in the midle of a Teostra fight and it was so infuriating. I'm currently playing gw2 on a friday reset. It's been okay. I got three body workouts in this week. Yesterday I learned about space time in the feynnman lectures. A key concept that blew my mind was that spacetime can have different zones of time if we look at it from a x/y coordinate. Past, present, future which can be affective or unobserved. I kind of understood this concept intuitively but visualizing it on a graph really surprised me. Affective zone are periods of time that can be observed like history or predictive models due to the speed of light being observable. Unobservable time is stuff that happened or will happen but the light is so far that it has yet to arrive making it unobservable and unknown time. Intuitive but complex concept.

Not a bad day. I read some Origin of Species by Charles Darwin and 40 Tales from the Afterlife. Darwin's book is a bit wordy and I don't think it's a digestible read at all. Sum is really good in that each short story is mind blowing and interesting. I went for a ride this morning around 11 am. It was chilly but not terrible. My knee had a slight ache and I had to take a dump but I was okay. I edited Sum short story and I really helped me get a perspective on life and the afterlife. Sum is about how all your lived experience is relived in the afterlife in order where all events with similar qualities are grouped and experienced all at once. So all pain is relived for its long duration etc. It makes me appreciated the temporal nature of current life.

I had an idea yesterday. I was sick of all these relapses and concluded that it occurs when my pc is on. 100% of the time. Therefore turning off my pc unless using it for work or play is the optimal solution.

So I'll revisit some of the more memorable videos and review them in my sites as a "best of IP."

Yesterday I did maybe 40% of my essay. It was on the lived environment in california and I chose to cover all time periods. My thesis was that California was heavily influenced by its economy at the time. For all the times people trash on Califonia, it is a human miracle. To take such diverse and exponential people and make a livable land for them all is incredible. I think compared to the past, California is better in terms of economy, lifestyle, comfort, safety, and mental duress. Just my two cents. I also figured out why the LEDs weren't working. It was a software issue not hardware. I felt bad. My Arduino code didn't include virtual pins and fastLED so obvious it wouldn't work. Live and learn. I reviewed how to remember, learn, and project confident body language making best of improvement pill too. To remember thing one needs to implement the effort principle. Basically the more effort you put in recording information the easy it is to retain. It's obvious but difficult to apply I think and often ignored. In learning we apply the Feynman technique, pretend to teach a topic in super basic terms like to third graders, poke holes in your knowledge, research more about these gaps, and repeat with friends/close ones. Finally in body language we learn that open body language is optimal: wide limbs, straight spinal system, relaxed, slighty happy face, take up space, and move slowly.

I havent watched this show since like 2017. It's crazy how much time has passed. The show makes me want to fight things and wakes up something primal within. I also watched some Dave Chappel particularly his show in Atlanta on Netflix. It's good. I love how he tells stories and somehow intertwines the meaning and values together near the end. I bought an ice cream maker yesterday and some locust bean gum powder as a stabilizer. My next batch is going to include yolk emulsifier and LGB stabilizer.

I finished season 3 of the last kingdom last night. It was really good. I haven't binged a show like that for a long while. Uhtred's story is epic.

I'm feeling better than I was a week ago. This self brainwashing is working. Today I listened to Cal on the Tim Ferriss show and boy this fellow can weave quite a tale. He's a journalist/writer who has been to many corners of the globe and tells stories that are so intriguing. I think his short story on Mikael Gorbachev and his father taking him to get ice cream was so powerful. I'll have to record them down for future reference, his tales are so uplifting with the setups and executions. Definitely one of the best interviews on the show.

I am good. I haven't said that in a long time. Yesterday I did some reading on California, I sped read so I don't really remember alot of the details but it was about the Black Panther, Caesar Chavez, and the Alcatraz occupation. All these people and events will eventually become lost in time. Do we remember the coronation of an ancient Sumerian king? No. Even with the permanence of modern technology I think much will become lost in time. Scriptures were recorded in tablets, much more permanent than wood but I digress. It is a part of what I learned reviewing IP yesterday. How to predict the future. Basically every field of knowledge is interconnected and by learning and immersing oneself in many different fields can one begin to more accurately predict futures using rules, constants, models, and gestalts. Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the Witcher 3. I can't believe it's been five years. Also Helix was put down yesterday.

Yesterday I streamed some mhw hunts and practiced guitar. I've got Hedwig's theme down but the hammer offs are difficult. Star wars I have the bits okay, not great but the sequences is still far from good. I learned about how to be more interesting. The basics is to be polarizing, that is to have opinions and views that are not safe or normal. Yet they must be true to you in that you truly believe in them. The second part is to be extremely honest with those opinions. Don't lie or conceal them as humans like to assume the worst of liers. Absolute honesty in regards to polarizing beliefs. This lead me into a thought I had this morning browsing reddit and the show The Last Kingdom I am currently watching (s4). There is a scene where Uhtred's daughter is captured in Wessex by the Danes who have taken the city of Winchester. She is tired of the duality of Danes versus Saxons and notes that they once shared a common ancestor. Their current conflict is one of old men. Pointless, traditional, outdated. The world has changed greatly from those times. 1000AD? Anyways these borders between humanity in modern times is how I feel about international conflict today. My polarizing belief. Another thing is that America is the guy who peaked in highschool in regards to freedom. In 1800s many countries when monarchs with limited individual freedom so America was a visionary in this field. Today not so much. Many countries enjoy more freedoms in all aspects of life. I stand by my view that even though real freedom is risky and difficult, it is the way more people should live. I say this because there cannot be growth without sacrifice and risk. I agree that structure is necessary but only enough to protect and enrich this sense of individual freedom to grow.

I started the power of now yesterday. I've been feeling despair lately. It's an imbalance I've felt before when recovering. The questioning of existence and why we should get out of bed. I want to talk about the power of now. I listened to the first hour of the audiobook and I'm pleasantly surprised. I remember hearing about this book in highschool, apparently it has been out since 2001. The book questions the human ability to think as a source of discomfort in life. It is extremely spiritual in nature. A concept it introduces is consciousness independent of thinking. Thinking as a human ability is useful and has been an evolutionary necessity but it has overtaken the ability to think for oneself. It is like accepted psychosis. Tolle also introduces the idea that being exists as a higher entity beyond thought comprehension that is within us all. Another point I like was that the word God has been overconvicted in a sense that everyone seems to believe they understand and know God in their own religions and ideologies or even in the opposite, they seem to know God de facto does not exist. To me it is pointless debate on an irrelevant topic. I'm curious to how this book will proceed, he who has discovered enlightenment. I also finished the Last Kingdom yesterday. I higher recommend that tv series. I has intrigue, conflict, romance, drama, decently written plot and twists. The ending of season was just phenomenal a treaty between danes and saxons.

Yesterday O spent most of my time on the writing response on the conservative worldview and its presence in Orange County. It has given me an understanding of the right that I had no appreciated in liberal California. I think it solidifies my centralist views at least in politics. The spent the rest of the day playing Yakuza 0 and Elite Dangerous and watching Rush. I like Rush as a player, streamer, and person. Funny yet dedicated and mentally strong. Super honest yet trolly in a self-actualized delusional way. I've had a slight headache yesterday I think I need to relax and not stare at a screen too much. I need breaks from these long sitting sessions. This afternoon I watched Dave Chappelle's The Age of Spin show. It is so good. He is an incredible story teller, in this particular show is weaves the controversies of Bill Cosby and OJ Simpson in a light that parables his views on the situations. Definitely one of my favorite shows if not my favorite. I also listened to Josh Waitzkin, the chess and martial arts prodigy. The part where is spoke about almost dying from passing out in a pool while swimming is deeply touching because he has a four year old and it could've been so much worse.

Yesterday was one of my more memorable birthdays. I turned 26 and we celebrated it at grandma's. We ate pho and had cake. Good stuff. I felt more in tune in conversations with Derek and noticing more the times when my mind is overwhelm in thought and emotion. After we went to Jenny and Lucy's to hangout. We had a lot of fun playing jack box party and talking about life. These past few days made me realize I have pretty good friends and family. My internal concept of my own loneliness is in fact a state of mind I notice. Lately I've been thinking about the future and how the pandemic has accelerated the realization that AI and remote work can overtake many industries. Those that adapt will thrive and those that don't will fail. Artificial intelligence and creative work will thrive I think and that is what I want to focus on during this time of uncertainty.

I think I suffered a heat stroke yesterday. Terrible migraine that I tried to power through by playing some gw2. It was quite painful. I ended up taking a nap and it was better. I've been watching chess on twitch, it's the newest meta. The game itself is seemingly complex but not too hard to comprehend once you learn the movement. The difficult part is foresight and speed I feel like. And then once you get proficient at that, the battle takes place in the mind. To know your opponent and act accordingly is the final frontier. It's crazy how efficient chess has gotten. At the end of the game a computer analyzes it and explains the mistakes and correct moves for the optimal play. At this point brute memorization and human error decides the fate of the game I think. Again this is from a guy who has never played a game of chess in his life.

Yesterday I learned to generate portraits in the Rembrandt style in less than an hour. AI generated is changing the way the world works. I was transcribing the Josh Waitzkin interview yesterday and I really enjoyed how he talked about his son and parenting in general. It's funny that this interview coincides with the chess craze on twitch. Josh used to be a chess prodigy in the early 00s. What stood out to me was how he is attuned to his child. What this means is that he is present and fully in the moment around little Jack. I really liked how people are taught weather is good or bad but it really isn't the case. We can have beautiful rainy days. Its something I myself struggle with at times based on what we are taught. Teaching a child to reframe discomfort through meditation rather than be repelled by it is a vital skill in life. Another thing I liked was the sense of proactivity Jack has thanks to his parents' encouragement to have an active role in his life. The ability to make decisions and take part in conversations and really impact the world. These are the things I want to instill in my child.

I got into Yakuza 0 more last night. I played until 4 am doing the pimp simulator. The cabaret business is just too fun. There just something satisfying serving and improving a business that serves the people. I spent more time trying to clear the legendary Mila battle. That shit is so imbalanced. -7 atk, map wide buffs, linear assist cancel, stupid resistances. I woke up at 3 pm today. I don't know just tired I guess. The Power of Now is somewhat the same and a bit repetitive and I'm nearing the half way point. Maybe it is my mind fighting it but I'm falling asleep listening to the audiobook.

I haven't been productive lately. I've been feeing better and motivated but not at a super human level of progress in terms of reading and goals. Most of the time has been spent on instant gratification in video games. Spiritually I am starting to grasp what I've been learning. Guided meditation from Waking Up by Sam Harris, Siddhartha, and power of now has been the most influential sources. I'm on chapter 14 of yakuza 0. The story is way better than I expected. I had an unexpected game theory lesson this morning surfing reddit. There was a post on /r/dataisbeautiful about the cooperate or cheat dilemma that delves into zero and non zero sum game theories. The takeaway is that copykittens, mimic others and cooperate with a second chance is the best result for mutual benefit and longevity. Purely capitalist and communist is cheater and cooperater. Human miscommunication and error attributes to cheating and skewed gains and distrust in general. Surprisingly the idiot character wins in simulated games with greater miscommunication.

I have been spending a lot of my time dabbling in digital art recently. I made gifs, ai renders, photoshops, and other random fancies. This line of thinking about how humanity is so interested in art in general was due to an interview with a doctor on the TF podcast this afternoon. He had been handicapped by an accident in college that led him to question his artistic identity in the world. When you think about it, art has no practical value. Drawings, paintings, music isn't one of the human needs to survive yet we put so much value in it.

I played some more mhw yesterday. The game is getting a bit stall after you've reached the endgame builds. I guess it get more fun with friends rather than pugs. I played more Elite Dangerous. It's a good pilot sim game, I was reading Ethics by Spinoza while playing. I'm still reading the translator's notes but it is interesting that he clarities a lot of Spinoza's views on religion, god, humanity, nature, etc in the prologue. I can see how much Spinoza has affected Einstein's views on these subjects. Some of these ideas and concept are starting to intertwine in some way. The more fields I can learn about the more I understand the concept of oneness I keep running into.

I started Assassin's Creed Origins yesterday. For a game released three years ago it hold up to many AAA games today. The time period made me realize that the Egyptians and Greeks lived in the same time and area. I just always seperated the two since they were different cultures. It's astounding to learn that the Egyptian culture lasted some 5,000 years. Recorded human history is less than 10,000 years but apparently homo sapiens have been around for at least 200,000 years. I forget these things but it trivializes the tiny history of modern humans and our glorified idealization of our time. I finished the final takeaway from IP yesterday. Ikigai. The reason for being. It is made up of four parts, something you love, something that the world needs, something that pays well, and something that you are good at. These four areas of living combine to form passion, mission, profession, and vocation. Only with a combination of all can one achieve ikigai or "happiness."

Assassinations aren't one hit kills anymore, it based on gear and level which is really weird for an AC game.

Monday. I relapsed yesterday. End of a twenty something day streak, one of my longest in a awhile. I feel disappointed and regret more than anything. The trigger was browsing lsf. I've blocked it from my reddit and filtered nsfw content. We move on. The urges and cravings after pmo is extremely intense. I don't really notice or think about it after a relapse but it's the definition of addiction. I couldn't think straight, demotivated, stayed in bed. The urges creeps up my throat and I just think about wanting the feeling. Breathing gets labored and I simply want relief from this will shattering pressure. At least today I am better. Fit, fed, and feeling okay. I did spend a lot of time just watching and procrastinating. I was watching MOTA, the international community gw2 pvp tournament. Ranked 55 dragons, Sind's team beat Team USA, it was pretty hype for the gw2 community since competitive content has been lacking these past years. Before this I was watching the Botez sisters play chess. Crazy how chess is the new meta on twitch. It's like this year's gta rp. They were doing impersonations of each other. The 5Head Alexandria and the Pepega Queen Andrea. Twitch has such a hive mind in terms of what's hot and what's not. I get influenced by it too, I've noticed. It seems like progress in how self aware I am becoming.

I've been reading the final pieces for my essay that I should be working on but doing everything else possible instead. It's a warm day today. 95F. I got some interesting insights from Arnold Schwarzenegger on how to improve the state of California and who he thought of when he heard the term successful. He answered a Roman Emperor who led very well in times of war and would leave the title of emperor once his job was over and return to farming. He did this twice and it reminds me of the story of George Washington who only took the title of president out of necessity. I can see a little of that in the late Arnold when he was the governator. It's very coincidental that this subject of rule happens to come across when I am playing assassin's creed Origins. I've always known in the back of my mind that Caesar and Cleopatra lived in the same time period but I never thought that they would interact so closely. I'm glad I played this even with the faults in the storyline.

I finished up my essay for California history final. I learned a lot about my home state from this course even though most of it was online due to covid. It has been a stressful week but I'm back on track. I'm on a 24 hour fast atm and managed to clean and workout this afternoon. Here is the conclusion to my essay, I'm quite proud of how I ended it: <blockquote>The past century proved that California was no golden dream yet the state and its people would carry on and make good from bad. California may not be the fictional utopia that many dream of but it is far beyond the dystopias that plagued its past. When you stand on the golden coast and look towards the setting sun burning the sky pink and orange, in the same bright hues as the surfers’ bathing suits; you forget its beautiful deception. You forget it was the smog that made the colors so brilliant, that behind every pretty picture there could be an ugly story (Connellly Michael, The Black Echo).</blockquote>

Saturday night Andrew, Steven, and I played Elite Dangerous. It was super fun. They were starting the game so I was showing them the ropes. Steven got jailed and had to take a loan to repurchase his ship. It was hilarious. Yesterday we had the backyard bbq of covid season. We invited Andrew, Annie, Larry, Lucy, Jenny, Kelly, and andrew's parents. It was a good time. A lot of food and funny moments. The dogs were great to play with too.

I finished the main story of AC origins just now and killed all the phylackes. Gorgeous game, poor writing near the end. It felt too edgy and rushed. I played a bunch of Elite Dangerous trying to do powerplays and new trade routes. In power of now I learned about the body, mind, and being/consciousness/spirit. I'm recovering from a relapse yesterday. It's crazy how these neurochemicals can have such an effect on the mood/feelings of the mind and body.

I cut my hair today in the style of Uhtred from the Last Kingdom. I'm playing a lot of Elite Dangerous. I never knew how addicted I could get to interstellar trading. Watching the tritium market for cheap prices and filling a hauler with 750 tons of it and selling it gives such a nice dopamine rush. It is definitely not healthy but I get why truckers do this. On the TF podcast we had the guy from Dirty Jobs on the Discovery channel. Man this guy is great at telling stories and improvising. He talked about the early days when he went from classical concert singer to QVC host/seller at 3am to getting a free pass to any american airline flight for months from doing a commercial gig. He also talked about the origins of dirty jobs and his grandfather which made me think about how I don't really have any manual skills I could apply like handyman skills. I liked the part about how he wanted to be genuine and raw with his work so everything was one take and he tried not to hide anything about the jobs. There were a couple of gems so I look forward to transcribing it.

Relapsed yesterday. I couldn't handle the loneliness and stress. One of my low points. I think it had to do with my high expectations. My relapses occur after a high day when I am in good company and loving life, the day after I feel the need to get that same high and it all comes crashing down when I can't achieve it or even worse when I doesn't go as I expected. This is the fundamental flaw of foresight and future thinking. This is why assumptions are so bad, it sets up preconceptions and expectations that is usually bad. This was referenced in the happiness course and four agreements. Knowledge is wasted if not experienced or practiced. I'm resetting and starting fresh right now. Reading and non zero days from now on. To implement this I'll have no computer sessions until 9 pm. Three hours of gaming time everyday. The rest goes to exercise and learning and improving. I'm going to watch Spanish shows to practice and learn spanish. It's time to stop having zero days, datys with self doubt, frustration, self-indulging. Practice gratitude to the three me's. Practice forgiveness to the past me. Exercise and read. 1, 2, 3, and 4.

I deconstructed Spinoza's reasoning on the existence of substance or God. It is a bunch of axioms, propositions, and scholiums about A and B logic, cause and effect, and quantity comparisons. It all a bit confusing but it follows logically. The one problem I have with it so far is that it cannot be argued against the given. By that I mean simply knowing God as a concept defines its existence and therefore it becomes given. Hard to explain I see that now. Knowing substance exists doesn't change much in my life so far but I hope that changes as I read more. I also deconstructed two of Tim's transcripts. Joshua Skenes, the michelin chef/ba gua student who cooks with fire. He was interesting but I didn't find much practical advice that was noteable. The other was Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs. I remember watching a little bit of his show in high school. It seems so long ago now. His views on education and life is very honest. His life is very interesting in that he treated his career like Forest Gump until he eventually had enough and changed himself at the age of 42 to be more serious in terms of his path in life. I also did srv scanning in elite dangerous yesterday. That was the most frustrating thing I did in that game. I hate that there was no tutorial and it was so difficult to operate without a guide or tutorial video and even then those didn't explain it very well.

I'm still going through Spinoza's logical arguments. I notice that the arguments are inarguable on the presence that it is absurd which kind of urks me. To prove something is wrong is one thing but to claim absurdity through self made claims is beyond reason. The reading is a bit ramblely too, Spinoza likes to clarify and reiterate the same points over and over. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it makes for a longer drier read. I also started Fooled by Randomness. Didn't get too far in yet but it makes me think of randomness in quantum physics something that Einstein did not fully accept. "God does not play dice." I was thinking that conflicting theories can be compatible even though Spinoza was against the idea that attributes of God cannot act against determination. I listened more to the gym coach on TF circa 2016. I like what I'm learning about mobility. Many of us think that strength training and cardio is all you need but mobility training is huge for skill work and sports and everyday functionality.

Yesterday was a mostly zero day. I did some yoga and then binged videogames and porn. A terrible cycle that repeated into the night. My lower back pain is back. I think it is because of improper form when doing my one arm pushup progression compounded by the deadlifts. It's not sharp but nagging. I forgot if that is good or bad. This morning as I tried to meditate, I listened to some Power of Now at the same time and he talked about temporary bliss from addictions and made it analogous to love.

Yesterday was a pretty good non zero day. I finished up the stuff yesterday. Christopher Sommer taught me that I need to improve my mobility and flexibility so I've added more of that into my warmups. I'm excited to do more band work and heal my lower back injury. Spinoza on the mind is a clutterfuck of confusion and wording. I tried reading some yesterday and fell asleep. I'll read more later and see if I can explain it more clearly. Center of mass in the Feynman lecture was a little maths heavy but basically it explains the idea that in everything on a nonatomic level, there is a center of mass that can be visuallize to contain all the movement vectors such as acceleration and torque. That idea can be expanded from a plane to a solid form. It helped me clarify the idea that Earth's rotation causes a coriolis effect, an inherit rotation based on the hemisphere one lives in. Of course the effect is only visible at a large scale such as a hurricane and not a toilet because the water pressure of the toilet is stronger than the subtle effect.

Unfortunately after flying for an hour or so and mining polonium, I crashed while orbital landing at the second site. Kind of rage inducing but I didn't feel too out of control. This morning I read the introduction for Fooled by Randomness and it is pretty much the opposite of Spinoza. Telab introduces the concept of Randomness to everything as opposite to Spinoza's Determinism. It's crazy to believe it's coincidental that I happen to get these two books recommended to me and I happen to read it at the same time. Both from Tim Ferriss' podcast I'm sure. But Spinoza's Ethics was from Einstein's biography recommended indirectly from Isaac Walter's Benjamin Franklin where as Fooled by Randomness was directly from Tim if I recall correctly. These books make me question the underlying construction of the universe.

Reckful committed suicide this morning. It was so surreal to me. I couldn't believe it. I tuned into twitch this afternoon and saw his stream playing reruns to 20k people and I was like good on you reckful, having a huge audience streaming a rerun and not very consistently. I saw chat talking about reckful but I didn't dawn upon me until I saw a gw2 stream title saying Reckful, you will be missed. Then it clicked. I've been crying and mourning for the majority of the day. Alexandria Botez's suicide awareness stream kind of helped. It made me aware that a quarter of us suffer from some form of mental illness and Reckful is no exception. The guy has been talking about suicide and mental illness for as long as I have watched him. I first tuned into his chat around 2017 or so with his Japan streams and followed on and off since then. His success and personality is very interesting. I was looking forward to the release of Everland, his twitch chat club penguin game. I don't know. When he talked on stream about how he couldn't live without being on shrooms and exercise didn't do anything for him, I sort of downplayed it and didn't really notice it. And the advent of covid-19 compounded the loneliness and pain inside of him. This situation really highlights the importance of self-care and mentality. We also watched a Ted talk on mental illness on Botez's stream and one point that really stuck out to me was the metaphor of 9/11 and suicide. If the building is on fire would you burn to death or jump to death? This is the mentally of a suicidal person. One you can end it painlessly and the other slow and agonizing. You are not a coward for jumping.

FeelsStrongMan. I have been playing a lot of videogames. Trying to escape the painful reality. I read the first chapter of Fooled by Randomness. It follows the story of Nero, a statistician turned securities trader who has found stability in randomness. I'm not too convinced about the author's message but it is more interesting than Ethics. I listened to a climber who lives in his van on the Tim Ferriss podcast today. It's interesting to hear about a different lifestyle and views of someone so different yet still relate in some ways. Small things like using a pee bottle and keeping cookies out of the house because we'd consume it instantly makes the conversation more memorable. I liked his comparison of fear to hunger. Fear is like hunger, you can learn to control it and do something about it rather than accept it and die. Fear doesn't kill you just like hunger doesn't. Fear is simply a reminder. There's nothing to fear but fear itself.

Fourth of July this year was not that great. There were some good points though. It was kind of hot yesterday and I played a lot of games. I finished up my raw material farm and flew down to Orion nebula and blew myself up to return to the bubble. I flew around in the mamba and pushed it until I ran out of fuel. This was the first time I ran out of fuel. I was amazed and terrified at the system shutting down and the lifesupport turning off. Oxygen was depleting. I called the fuel rats and I was super impressed by their system. They had dispatchers and codes and responders and everything. It was so cool. In mhw I theorycrafted an Alatreon set and did a biohazard blackveil vaal using zombie form. It was so fun tanking and regening vaal and not rolling. I was a bit lonely when I didn't spent july 4th with anyone but at least I ended on a good note.

Oof. Not a good couple of days. It's been hot and unproductive. The books I am reading right now are Ethics by Bausch? Spinoza, I haven't been reading this a lot recently. The text is just confusing but the ideas are quite enlightening. I've finished the Thought section and I feel like I didn't take away much since the text was so dry. Power of now I am listening to. The ideas are interesting but structure is lacking. The author branches from topic to topic without really emphasizing the main point. I notice that I am just complaining and criticizing the literature at this point. It show the state of mind I am in right now. Covid is spiking again and a lot of drama is going on with cancel culture and coming out with allegations. My mentality is just low especially after what happened with Byron. It's almost a week and people are starting to forget and move on. It hurts to think about. In the TF podcast we had an author and journalist, Sebastian Junger, who documents war and tribal societies. I found this podcast quite interesting and there are many highlights that stood out to me.

It's been a depressive couple of days. One saving grace is that I finished reading A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks. I genuinely enjoyed reading the story of Landon and Jaime. A modern romeo and juliet I suppose. My motivation is low and the momentum from May is dwindling. Since the wave two of covid, I haven't been doing much. I purchased persona 4 and started that. I was ganked for the first time in Elite Dangerous and it put me off. Could be worse could be better. Lot of mhw and such. I'm feeling lonely. I want to keep improving like in May but I just don't notice the progress. I'm losing weight such quarantine. Yesterday while working out I listened to Kevin Kelly, the futurist. I was moved by his view on the future with regards to AI and VR. I think it is something I'm going to focus on for my vocation. Yesterday I also had a manic episode of moving to another country. How America has handled covid and recent events in general has got me down. Randomly low "bad" events have been happening every damn week recently. I reviewed some country based on power, quality of life, citizenship, and GDP per capita/movers and came to a conclusion of seven countries that I would like citizenship, a permanent residency, or a home base. For quality of life I came up with Canada and Switzerland. I think that a permanent home in these two countries would be the best for my life. Free healthcare and education, solid governments, liberties, language compatibility, culture, neutrality, just a lot of quality of life. 5 years for canadian citizenship and 10 for swiss. For homebases for travel I have picked Japan and Australia. They are in the same timezones but different hemispheres so I can stay in wonderful climate year round. Australian citizenship is surprisingly simple with just p.r. I have family there so that is a bonus. Japan because it is a central location for asian travel and I have an affinity for Japanese culture and language. For power I think I'll maintain a home base in California. I'm not sure where for most of these ideas but being American just has the rusting implications that come with being a world power. After taking that class on the history of california I've come to understand and love the state I grew up in with it's trends and past. Finally other homebases I would like are in Singapore and Qatar. SEA and Middle East. These countries are the movers with insane GDP per capita and individual wealth. I think these young countries will have significant global impact in the coming years and to maintain a residency here would help me grow as a person and allow me to experience and influence the future of humanity. There are my seven countries I'm going to live in. Canada, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, United States, Singapore, and Qatar.

It's been nearly another week. I've finished persona 4 and unbearable lightness of being. Persona's true ending was amazing and heartfelt. Lightness of being was enjoyable too; it read like a dream and introduced me to the eastern europe communist era. I was left feeling unsure about the book. It was interesting enough to finish. Characters like Sabina, Tomas, Tereza, and Karenin were my favorite and they kept me interested but the book didn't really have an evident conclusion or high highs or low lows. I guess that was why it was so interesting. A fiction written like real life. I've restarted persona 3 fes ng+ and I have been playing a lot of gw2 because the festival of the four winds is back along with no downstate wvw. I'm enjoying these things immensely but I get a feeling that I could be doing something more with my life. There are some worrying thoughts about my future and my productivity and motivation and stagnation and individual strengths and weaknesses. I think I need to meditate again and keep daily journal entries. AHHHHH. This past few days have been extremely hot too. It was 100+ yesterday and still going.

Times really flies. It's nearing the end of August and I haven't progressed much. Bunch of relapses and jerking off. More events regarding racial injustice has been occuring and covid in the US still persists. Guild wars 2 confimed it's third expansion in Cantha and I am hyped. Lakers have been playing in the bubble in Orlando for the playoffs currently 3-1 against Trailblazers. I am shifting my virtual environment to accommodate a more productive work environment by creating a flow user that has no distractions and little Internet accessibility. I've started Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace and I'm itchy because of bug bites. The heat wave has been receding but it's still warm.

A pretty decent day. I did some afternoon yoga then changed the bed sheets. God damn bugs nipping on my feet. I cut my hair and then showered. Got some protein shake and then grilled two lovely cheeseburgers with charred garlic buns. Didn't look good but tasted amazing. Oh yeah I started meditating again using an app. It helps to quiet my mind. The nba playoffs was postponed yesterday as a protest against a cop killing of an african american boy.

Kobe death

I can't even go two full days. I attempted to be as productive as possible yesterday and today. I managed to review IP and reread Shay Carl's podcast. Lakers won. I had a hard time falling asleep. I had a food coma and napped around 9 pm. Not the best idea. I couldn't fall asleep until 5 am. I lied in bed for two or three hours. Drudged through my first strength training this week and it sucked. The sky is heavy with wildfire smoke and the sun is barely visible. Last night while procrastinating sleep I watched a tutorial on how to improve masking and rendering in photoshop. Using this program for decades now I actually learned new techniques and it blew my mind. I just watched nba the rest of today and relapsed with nobody home. I have a slight headache with this shitty air and over indulgence. Not good. I'm thinking about redoing my resume and applying for remote jobs.

Do you remember the 21st night of September? A whole damn week already. My regression is getting worse. I've finished my second playthrough of persona 3 and did not enjoy it as much. The amount of min-maxing gear and social links took the fun away from it. Getting to experience all the social links was good though. My favorite characters were Saori the Liberian, Shinji the closet cook, and Akinari the dying young man. To experience their epilogues was bitter sweet. I received my xbox one controller and found one the right trigger was too tight resulting in sticky trigger. I ordered some custom buttons and took it apart, it looks amazing but I wished the build quality was like the 360. It just feels plasticky and cheap for a $60 controller. On thursday I went to grandma's for kbbq at home. They had a tepanyaki grill to cook everything fresh and delicious. I enjoyed it a lot. I've started reading two other books on top of my other ones for months now.. My promise of one book a week has failed miserably. One is a biography on George Washington and the other is a self-help book on the one thing to success. The Lakers are two games up in the western conference finals with an amazing buzzer beating from Anthony Davis yesterday.

Tuesday night. I did some yoga this afternoon after modding mhw and installing efx mods. I started persona 5 and it's realy good so far. The characters and stories are enticing. The beginning is a lot on rails compared to the other games. That is my only grip. Yesterday I looked into dementia and alzheimer's and when I woke up I watched an IP on winning the game of life. The title is so clickbaity but I did get some insights on what to focus on and it did motivate me briefly. Lakers lost just now so it's 2-1.

Lovely warm friday today. I played some mhw, grinding and theorycrafting some fatalis sets. Did some strength work and I am about to go to grandma's for fried fish. Wonderful. I reread some interviews yesterday and today and I really liked the soliloquy from Tony Robbins about how there are two ways to react to life. you can let live happen to you or for you. There is a silver lining in all things we simply need to stop reacting negatively and find it. Today I listened to an interview with one of the founders of acroyoga.

It is nearing halloween. A lot of things are back to normal yet the cases of covid has spiked. It is still not over and stuff is open but online. Life has been stagnant. I don't have a clearly defined goal, simply drifting in the void. Staying at home with very little social contact has been a prison cell for the mind. I seek escape in any form of entertainment to forget my present existence. Not entirely nihilistic but not entirely anywhere.

November has past by so quickly. I have been watching a lot of vrchat. Watching it again since moonmoon started months ago. It's has changed a lot since 2018 but not really. Fundamentally the same game but extremely different thanks to the community and agreed upon social structures. It give the game is novelty factor unparalleled. The creativity of map creators and avatar makers also spice things up and makes it a second world of infinite possibilities. The presidential election is also over, Biden beat Trump and the country is in a celebratory state even with the wave three of covid.

Yesterday I finished reading rule 10 about being precise with your speech. Basically being honest as cliche as it is is the best way to live. Lies and ignorance leads to a buildup also known as the dragon in the room. If one is honest with themselves and others, the metaphorical dragon shrinks. If the dragon is allowed to grow, over time it will present itself and life will not be so pleasant. Being precise is being specific with what you want and how you feel with yourself and others. That way communication isn't vague and chaotic. We can only control so much of what is around us that being unclear of our intentions leads to meaningless floating. I also watched a video on naltrexone, a drug that inhibits the release for opioids, a precursor for dopamine. By taking naltrexone and then taking part in the harmful addiction one does no derive much positive feedback since the receptors are blocked. So it rewires the neuro pathways to see the bad habit as worthless. Recommended dose is 50 mg of naltrexone 1 hour before the bad activity. Avoid naturally rewarding activities while it is still in your system, e.g. exercise, eating, interacting with people. I also refreshed myself about willpower and how it isn't unlimited and varies. A key idea was that it can be trained with intentional focus on the idea of willpower. Say one is aware that they have limited willpower they can focus on using it on the important tasks and schedule things ahead of time. The list of what depletes it was good too. Other things: vr chat, gw2 episode idk came out, twitch adwars.

California is going into shutdown once more. I've been feeling an ungodly amount of loneliness and despair recently. Yesterday I read about balance in the one thing. It describes true 50/50 balance as an impossibility in work life balance. One should zig zag between them while maintaining long periods of meaningful work and short maintenance periods of life balance. That is the only way to achieve aspirations without sacrificing too much or drifting through life. I also looked into vitamins and minerals in WIL. In essence, there are too many unknown variables that cannot/haven't been tested of the interactions between v/m and whole foods. Differences in genetics also affects the one size fits all methods of v/m.

It has been a week or two. Thanksgiving was really good this year. We had homecooked kbbq and sushi at grandma's. I ate so much. For dad's side we hung out in discord playing amoung us and jackbox party. It was fun. These past weeks have been okay but became worse over time. WoW shadowlands released and I have been watching that and vrchat for the majority. The rp nights at the golden gator has been awesome. The mute olympics starts friday. Dad went overbearing mode once more and cut the internet last night so here I am. Glass half full I guess. I purchased the Monoprice Retros and some new pads so I'm excited about that. I've started reading again albeit not consistently at all. I'm trying to finish Spinoza's ethics but it is so wordy and archaic that reading it fast and comprehending it unlikely. Some other things I'm thinking about is learning Blender/Unity for creating things in vrchat and apply for a job at a vr company. I think that 2020 has shown that the world is moving towards a more disconnected interconnected world. We want efficiency and technological connections. Finally the covid vaccine is ready for distribution pending approval from the fda. There are about four big companies with their own vaccination methods. They should be released in the coming weeks.
